  abstract = {Plasticity at central synapses has long been thought to be the most
	likely mechanism for learning and memory, but testing that idea experimentally
	has proven to be difficult. For this reason, we have developed a
	simplified preparation of the Aplysia siphon withdrawal reflex that
	allows one to examine behavioral learning and memory while simultaneously
	monitoring synaptic connections between individual identified neurons
	in the CNS. We previously found that monosynaptic connections from
	LE siphon sensory neurons to LFS siphon motor neurons make a substantial
	contribution to the reflex in the siphon withdrawal preparation (Antonov
	et al., 1999a). We have now used that preparation to assess the contribution
	of various cellular mechanisms to classical conditioning of the reflex
	with a siphon tap conditioned stimulus (CS) and tail shock unconditioned
	stimulus (US). We find that, compared with unpaired training, paired
	training with the CS and US produces greater enhancement of siphon
	withdrawal and evoked firing of LFS neurons, greater facilitation
	of the complex PSP elicited in an LFS neuron by the siphon tap, and
	greater facilitation of the monosynaptic PSP elicited by stimulation
	of a single LE neuron. Moreover, the enhanced facilitation of monosynaptic
	LE-LFS PSPs is greater for LE neurons that fire during the siphon
	tap and correlates significantly with the enhancement of siphon withdrawal
	and evoked firing of the LFS neurons. These results provide the most
	direct evidence to date that activity-dependent plasticity at specific
	central synapses contributes to behavioral conditioning and support
	the idea that synaptic plasticity is a mechanism of learning and
	memory more generally.},

	However, recent studies indicate that subthreshold variation in the

	The informational content of each presynaptic action potential is
	therefore greater than initially expected. The contribution of this
	synaptic property, which is a fast (from 0.01 to 10 s) and state-dependent
	modulation of functional coupling, has been largely underestimated
	and could have important consequences for our understanding of information
	processing in neural networks. We discuss here how the membrane voltage

	by mechanisms that do not involve a change in presynaptic Ca(2+)

	on the first odor-processing network in the honeybee brain, the antennal
	lobe, which corresponds to the vertebrate olfactory bulb. We stained
	output neurons with a calcium-sensitive dye and measured across-glomerular
	patterns of spontaneous activity before and after a stimulus. Such
	a single-odor presentation changed the relative timing of spontaneous
	activity across glomeruli in accordance with Hebb's theory of learning.
	Moreover, during the first few minutes after odor presentation, correlations
	between the spontaneous activity fluctuations suffice to reconstruct
	the stimulus. As spontaneous activity is ubiquitous in the brain,
	modifiable fluctuations could provide an ideal substrate for Hebbian
	reverberations and sensory memory in other neural systems.},
