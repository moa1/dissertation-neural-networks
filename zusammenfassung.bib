  Abstract                 = {Plasticity at central synapses has long been thought to be the most likely mechanism for learning and memory, but testing that idea experimentally has proven to be difficult. For this reason, we have developed a simplified preparation of the Aplysia siphon withdrawal reflex that allows one to examine behavioral learning and memory while simultaneously monitoring synaptic connections between individual identified neurons in the CNS. We previously found that monosynaptic connections from LE siphon sensory neurons to LFS siphon motor neurons make a substantial contribution to the reflex in the siphon withdrawal preparation (Antonov et al., 1999a). We have now used that preparation to assess the contribution of various cellular mechanisms to classical conditioning of the reflex with a siphon tap conditioned stimulus (CS) and tail shock unconditioned stimulus (US). We find that, compared with unpaired training, paired training with the CS and US produces greater enhancement of siphon withdrawal and evoked firing of LFS neurons, greater facilitation of the complex PSP elicited in an LFS neuron by the siphon tap, and greater facilitation of the monosynaptic PSP elicited by stimulation of a single LE neuron. Moreover, the enhanced facilitation of monosynaptic LE-LFS PSPs is greater for LE neurons that fire during the siphon tap and correlates significantly with the enhancement of siphon withdrawal and evoked firing of the LFS neurons. These results provide the most direct evidence to date that activity-dependent plasticity at specific central synapses contributes to behavioral conditioning and support the idea that synaptic plasticity is a mechanism of learning and memory more generally.},

  Abstract                 = {Classification algorithms for high-dimensional biological data like gene expression profiles or metabolomic fingerprints are typically evaluated by the number of misclassifications across a test dataset. However, to judge the classification of a single case in the context of clinical diagnosis, we need to assess the uncertainties associated with that individual case rather than the average accuracy across many cases. Reliability of individual classifications can be expressed in terms of class probabilities. While classification algorithms are a well-developed area of research, the estimation of class probabilities is considerably less progressed in biology, with only a few classification algorithms that provide estimated class probabilities.We compared several probability estimators in the context of classification of metabolomics profiles. Evaluation criteria included sparseness biases, calibration of the estimator, the variance of the estimator and its performance in identifying highly reliable classifications. We observed that several of them display artifacts that compromise their use in practice. Classification probabilities based on a combination of local cross-validation error rates and monotone regression prove superior in metabolomic profiling.The source code written in R is freely available at http://compdiag.uni-regensburg.de/software/probEstimation.shtml.inka.appel@klinik.uni-regensburg.de.},

Feed forward neural networks were recently considered for flexible non-linear modelling of censored survival data through the generalization of both discrete and continuous time models. We show that by treating the time interval as an input variable in a standard feed forward network with logistic activation and entropy error function, it is possible to estimate smoothed discrete hazards as conditional probabilities of failure. We considered an easily implementable approach with a fast selection criteria of the best configurations. Examples on data sets from two clinical trials are provided. The proposed artificial neural network (ANN) approach can be applied for the estimation of the functional relationships between covariates and time in survival data to improve model predictivity in the presence of complex prognostic relationships.},

  Abstract                 = {To increase the ability of ultrasonographic technology for the differential diagnosis of solid breast tumors, we describe a novel computer-aided diagnosis (CADx) system using neural networks for classification of breast tumors. Tumor regions and surrounding tissues are segmented from the physician-located region-of-interest (ROI) images by applying our proposed segmentation algorithm. Cooperating with the segmentation algorithm, three feasible features, including variance contrast, autocorrelation contrast and distribution distortion of wavelet coefficients, were extracted from the ROI images for further classification. A multilayered perceptron (MLP) neural network trained using error back-propagation algorithm with momentum was then used for the differential diagnosis of breast tumors on sonograms. In the experiment, 242 cases (including benign breast tumors from 161 patients and carcinomas from 82 patients) were sampled with k-fold cross-validation (k = 10) to evaluate the performance. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) area index for the proposed CADx system is 0.9396 +/- 0.0183, the sensitivity is 98.77\%, the specificity is 81.37\%, the positive predictive value is 72.73\% and the negative predictive value is 99.24\%. Experimental results showed that our diagnosis model performed very well for breast tumor diagnosis.},

  Abstract                 = {Synaptic transmission in the brain generally depends on action potentials. However, recent studies indicate that subthreshold variation in the presynaptic membrane potential also determines spike-evoked transmission. The informational content of each presynaptic action potential is therefore greater than initially expected. The contribution of this synaptic property, which is a fast (from 0.01 to 10 s) and state-dependent modulation of functional coupling, has been largely underestimated and could have important consequences for our understanding of information processing in neural networks. We discuss here how the membrane voltage of the presynaptic terminal might modulate neurotransmitter release by mechanisms that do not involve a change in presynaptic Ca(2+) influx.},

  Abstract                 = {Malignant melanoma is the deadliest form of all skin cancers. Approximately 32,000 new cases of malignant melanoma were diagnosed in 1991 in the United States, with approximately 80\% of patients expected to survive five years [1]. Fortunately, if detected early, even malignant melanoma may be treated successfully. Thus, in recent years, there has been rising interest in the automated detection and diagnosis of skin cancer, particularly malignant melanoma [2]. In this paper, we present a novel neural network approach for the automated separation of melanoma from three benign categories of tumors which exhibit melanoma-like characteristics. Our approach uses discriminant features, based on tumor shape and relative tumor color, that are supplied to an artificial neural network for classification of tumor images as malignant or benign. With this approach, for reasonably balanced training/testing sets, we are able to obtain above 80\% correct classification of the malignant and benign tumors on real skin tumor images.},

  Abstract                 = {Sensory memory is a short-lived persistence of a sensory stimulus in the nervous system, such as iconic memory in the visual system. However, little is known about the mechanisms underlying olfactory sensory memory. We have therefore analyzed the effect of odor stimuli on the first odor-processing network in the honeybee brain, the antennal lobe, which corresponds to the vertebrate olfactory bulb. We stained output neurons with a calcium-sensitive dye and measured across-glomerular patterns of spontaneous activity before and after a stimulus. Such a single-odor presentation changed the relative timing of spontaneous activity across glomeruli in accordance with Hebb's theory of learning. Moreover, during the first few minutes after odor presentation, correlations between the spontaneous activity fluctuations suffice to reconstruct the stimulus. As spontaneous activity is ubiquitous in the brain, modifiable fluctuations could provide an ideal substrate for Hebbian reverberations and sensory memory in other neural systems.},

Gradient descent can be used for fine-tuning the weights in such "autoencoder" networks, but this works well only if the initial weights are close to a good solution. We describe an effective way of initializing the weights that allows deep autoencoder networks to learn low-dimensional codes that work much better than principal components analysis as a tool to reduce the dimensionality of data.},
