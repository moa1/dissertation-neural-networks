  Abstract                 = {Plasticity at central synapses has long been thought to be the most likely mechanism for learning and memory, but testing that idea experimentally has proven to be difficult. For this reason, we have developed a simplified preparation of the Aplysia siphon withdrawal reflex that allows one to examine behavioral learning and memory while simultaneously monitoring synaptic connections between individual identified neurons in the CNS. We previously found that monosynaptic connections from LE siphon sensory neurons to LFS siphon motor neurons make a substantial contribution to the reflex in the siphon withdrawal preparation (Antonov et al., 1999a). We have now used that preparation to assess the contribution of various cellular mechanisms to classical conditioning of the reflex with a siphon tap conditioned stimulus (CS) and tail shock unconditioned stimulus (US). We find that, compared with unpaired training, paired training with the CS and US produces greater enhancement of siphon withdrawal and evoked firing of LFS neurons, greater facilitation of the complex PSP elicited in an LFS neuron by the siphon tap, and greater facilitation of the monosynaptic PSP elicited by stimulation of a single LE neuron. Moreover, the enhanced facilitation of monosynaptic LE-LFS PSPs is greater for LE neurons that fire during the siphon tap and correlates significantly with the enhancement of siphon withdrawal and evoked firing of the LFS neurons. These results provide the most direct evidence to date that activity-dependent plasticity at specific central synapses contributes to behavioral conditioning and support the idea that synaptic plasticity is a mechanism of learning and memory more generally.},

  Abstract                 = {Synaptic transmission in the brain generally depends on action potentials. However, recent studies indicate that subthreshold variation in the presynaptic membrane potential also determines spike-evoked transmission. The informational content of each presynaptic action potential is therefore greater than initially expected. The contribution of this synaptic property, which is a fast (from 0.01 to 10 s) and state-dependent modulation of functional coupling, has been largely underestimated and could have important consequences for our understanding of information processing in neural networks. We discuss here how the membrane voltage of the presynaptic terminal might modulate neurotransmitter release by mechanisms that do not involve a change in presynaptic Ca(2+) influx.},

  Abstract                 = {Sensory memory is a short-lived persistence of a sensory stimulus in the nervous system, such as iconic memory in the visual system. However, little is known about the mechanisms underlying olfactory sensory memory. We have therefore analyzed the effect of odor stimuli on the first odor-processing network in the honeybee brain, the antennal lobe, which corresponds to the vertebrate olfactory bulb. We stained output neurons with a calcium-sensitive dye and measured across-glomerular patterns of spontaneous activity before and after a stimulus. Such a single-odor presentation changed the relative timing of spontaneous activity across glomeruli in accordance with Hebb's theory of learning. Moreover, during the first few minutes after odor presentation, correlations between the spontaneous activity fluctuations suffice to reconstruct the stimulus. As spontaneous activity is ubiquitous in the brain, modifiable fluctuations could provide an ideal substrate for Hebbian reverberations and sensory memory in other neural systems.},
