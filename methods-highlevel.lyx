Artificial neuronal networks
\end_layout

\end_inset

Artificial neuronal networks are mathematical constructs, designed to imitate
 the signal processing capabilities of real neurons, found in nearly all
 animals.
 Like their biological counterparts, artificial neuronal networks consist
 of simpler building blocks, the neurons.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Neurons as basic signal processing units
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The real, biological neurons are defined (according to the neuron doctrine
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

) as the smallest units whose state change may be called signal processing,
 so they are the basic signal processing units.
 They have multiple inputs (dendrites) and multiple outputs (axons)
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 In most real neurons, the signal transmission and processing is facilitated
 by alternating small electric (action) potentials (along the axons) and
 chemical transmissions (at chemical synapses between axon and dendrite).
 The electric potential is transmitted along the dendrites of a neuron,
 and flows to the axon of the neuron, which can lead to the release of neurotran
smitters in the axon terminals.
 The neurotransmitters cause ion channels in the adjacent dendrites of other
 neurons to open, which changes their membrane potential.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Action potentials, their propagation, and chemical synapses 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The action potentials are realized by cells in the form of different ion
 concentrations inside and outside the cell.
 These ion gradients are maintained in the resting state by 
\begin_inset Formula $Na^{+}/K^{+}$
\end_inset

-ATPases that pump 3 
\begin_inset Formula $Na^{+}$
\end_inset

 ions out of and 2 
\begin_inset Formula $K^{+}$
\end_inset

 ions into the cell for every ATP molecule
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "LodishZipursky2000"

\end_inset

.
 Because ions are charged, there is an electric potential between the outside
 and inside of the cell.
 (The resting potential is between -80mV and -40mV, depending on the type
 of neuron.) The electric potential becoming more positive is called depolarizati
on, and the opposite hyperpolarization.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The propagation of the action potentials along dendrites is realized by
 the opening and closing of ion channels.
 Once depolarization of an adjacent region of a neuron causes the electric
 potential between the inside and outside of a 
\begin_inset Formula $Na^{+}$
\end_inset

 ion channel to reach a critical value, the ion channel opens, causing further
 depolarization in adjacent regions of the neuron.
 This positive feedback loop continues until all 
\begin_inset Formula $Na^{+}$
\end_inset

 channels are open.
 At the peak of depolarization, 
\begin_inset Formula $K^{+}$
\end_inset

 ion channels open, causing hyperpolarization, and the potential returns
 to the resting  potential.
 This makes the action potential travel along the neuron.
 Once it has reached an axon terminal, it causes neurotransmitter release.

\begin_layout Standard
Neurotransmitters binding to receptors

\end_inset

 present on the outside of the neuron's membrane cause ion channels to open,
 and the ions flow into or out of the cell to achieve equilibrium of ion
 concentration.
 The type of ion channel being opened upon binding of a neurotransmitter
 can cause either depolarization or hyperpolarization of the dendrite, depending
 on the charge of the ion, and whether the resting concentration of the
 ion is higher intracellular or extracellular.
 If a critical threshold of depolarization is reached, the 
\begin_inset Formula $Na^{+}$
\end_inset

 ion channels will open, and an action potential

 spike that carries the information from one neuron to the next.
 For example, the strength muscles are innervated with is encoded in the
 number of action potentials per time delivered by the muscle neuron to
 the muscle fiber.
 However, some neurons involved in perception directly transmit information
 in the fluctuations of neurotransmitter released.
 This analogue mode of transmission allows more information to be transmitted
 per time.
 Sub-threshold emission of neurotransmitter also seems to modulate subsequent
 action potentials, allowing for a mixture of analogue and digital information
 transmission

 The machinery facilitating propagation and transmission of information
 in and between biological neurons is highly simplified in artificial neurons.

artificial neuron signal processing
\end_layout

\end_inset

Signal processing of a real neuron is modelled in an artificial neuron as
 a mathematical function that has multiple input variables, computes a value
 according to the function formula and its parameters and outputs its computed
 value to multiple neurons, which use it as an input variable.
 Herein, the processes of neurotransmitter release, de- and hyperpolarization,
 and propagation of the action potential are abstracted away into discrete
 time steps.

The effect of an incoming axon onto a neuron, that is, the different types
 of receptors that can be present on the outside of a real dendrite, and
 the effected de- or hyperpolarization of the dendrite are abstracted away
 by using real-numbered weights.
 These are parameters to the mathematical function describing the accumulation
 and modulation of the vector of outputs of artificial neurons to form the

Learning
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Nervous systems do not only process signals, but they also learn, that means
 that they adapt their signal processing over time.
 One reason for this is an organism's need for a change in behavior, as
 response to a changing environment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In biological neuronal systems, this is possible by altering or exchanging
 the receptors on the surface of dendrites, or by connecting the axon terminals
 of a neuron to different neurons.
 Strengthening of the synaptic link (that occurs within minutes and remains
 after hours and days in mammals) is called long-term potentiation (LTP),
 while its weakening is called long-term depression (LTD).
 LTP is induced by associativity of connected neurons, that is, the

\begin_layout Standard
In artificial neuronal networks, and machine learning in general, there
 are two major types of learning: supervised and unsupervised learning.
 In supervised learning, for every input pattern in the data set there is
 defined an output pattern that the learner should compute from the input
 pattern.
 This means the algorithm should infer a function that maps from the space
 of input patterns to the space of output patterns.
 In unsupervised learning, there
