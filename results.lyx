Reasons for choosing GSE25055 and GSE25065 as the data set
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Originally we wanted to find a data set that had something to do with drug
 sensitivity and resistance.
 Therefore a GEO (TODO: cite GEO) database search was conducted.
 All data sets uploaded to GEO between January 1st 2000, and August 31st
 2013 were considered and searched for 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

sensitiv
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

resist
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 The ones having a match in title or abstract were sorted by the number
 of samples in the data set.
 GSE25055 and GSE25065 were among those that really had something to do
 with drug sensitivity and had a relatively high sample count.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
GSE25055 and GSE25065 are data sets produced for the same paper, namely
 (TODO: cite the GEO25055 paper, I think it is by Hatzis et al.).
 In this paper, GSE25055 was used to generate a classifier for the prognosis
 of breast cancer patients that received reductive surgery followed by taxane-an
thracycline chemotherapy.
 All patients had ERBB2 (HER2 or HER2/neu)-negative breast cancer.
 The tissue extracted in reductive surgery was measured on Affymetrix HG-U133A
 microarrays.
 After a mean of 3 years, the patients were labeled as either showing pathologic
 complete response (
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

pCR
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

; class 1; there was no sign of a remaining breast cancer) to chemotherapy
 or residual disease (
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

RD
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

; class 0; there was still cancerous tissue).
 The classifier was then tested on an independently measured data set, GSE25065.
 The classifier's performance was tested based on (TODO: review something
 about the results of the GSE25055 paper by Hatzis & Symmans).

Goal of this work
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The goals of this work were: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
to find out whether incorporating unlabeled expression data in the training
 of deep artificial neuronal networks enhances a classifier's performance.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
to assess performance of the classifier on an independently measured data
 set.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Two types of neuronal networks that lend themselves for semi-supervised
 training were used: auto-encoders and deep belief networks.
 Parallel to these, the performance of a semi-supervised version of Support
 Vector Machines, namely the Transductive SVM was evaluated.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Four normalization methods were tried: two microarray normalization methods
 were tried: Robust Multi-Chip Average (RMA) (TODO: cite), MAS5 (TODO: cite).
 These were tried without or with subsequent ComBat (TODO: cite) batch-effect
 correction.
 Two prediction goals were tried: (TODO: look up the exact labels that were
 used for prediction.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Note Note
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
One label was on a data set whose prediction reached an accuracy (of about
 75%) that is equal to the accuracy reached by betting on the larger group
 (see ~/uni-publication/progress_report_201411/progress_report_20141118.pdf),
 and one label didn't work, that is, it did not enhance the classifiers'
 accuracies.
 (see ~/uni-publication/progress_report_201507/presentation-20150707.pdf)).
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As we will see, none of the attempts with artificial neuronal networks showed
 that adding unlabeled data in training leads to better classifiers.
 However, also TSVM did not show improvement when adding unlabeled data
 to training.
 We therefore think that it is probably the fault of the data set.
 Contrary to the data sets (hand-written digit classification and graphical
 object recognition) on which the discussed artificial neuronal networks
 were developed, and on which they are among the best-performing predictors,
 expression data sets have sizes which are several magnitudes smaller.
 This is probably due to the price of microarrays (and RNASeq), which is
 magnitudes larger than the price to take pictures of hand-written digits
 or objects.

\begin_layout Paragraph
Issues in running 
\emph on
deepnet
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
deepnet
\emph default
 (TODO: cite) is a neuronal network implementation written by Nitish Srivastava
 and uses a matrix library written by Krishevski (TODO: oder so).
 It can run on NVIDIA graphics cards supporting CUDA.
 Due to graphics cards having a highly parallel architecture, this means
 faster training times.
 However, because graphics cards have to process large data, their RAM is
 more expensive than normal RAM for PCs.
 The NVIDIA graphics cards in the Regensburg Athene cluster computers have
 4 GB of RAM installed.
 Because 
\emph on
deepnet
\emph default
 loads all data sets at the beginning of computation onto the graphics card,
 this means that the data sets may not be larger than 4 GB.
 However, as mentioned, the matrix library can also run on the normal floating-p
oint unit of normal CPU.
 There was a bug in 
\emph on
deepnet
\emph default
 when run on 64-bit CPUs, which I fixed.
 (TODO: include the bugfix here).
 Most of the data sets were trained on rhskl11, which has 128GB of RAM (TODO:
 or 256GB?), which was more than enough for the data sets tested.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
How unlabeled data was used in training Auto-Encoders
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Because auto-encoders
\begin_inset Index idx
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
auto-encoders
\end_layout

\end_inset

 are composed of an encoder
\begin_inset Index idx
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
encoder
\end_layout

\end_inset

 and a decoder
\begin_inset Index idx
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
decoder
\end_layout

\end_inset

 and the encoder tries to compress the input data and the decoder tries
 to reconstruct the input from its compressed form, training them is unsupervise
d.
 The unlabeled data are therefore handled like the labeled data, because
 the label is unused in training the autoencoder.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The decoder network of the trained autoencoder was then thrown away, so
 that only the encoder remained.
 Classification was done on the compressed respresentation of the input.
 The classifier network was built on top of the encoder, and the compressed
 output layer of the encoder was connected to the input layer of the classifier.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(TODO: Bild wie unten auf Slide 7 von ~/uni-publication/progress_report_201411/p
rogress_report_20141118.pdf einfügen.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The weights of the classifier were initialized randomly, and standard back-propa
gtion was used to train the whole network to classify samples.
 This means that the encoder can be modified by back-propagation training,
 but pre-training with the auto-encoder initializes it to a configuration
 that 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

knows
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 about the unlabeled samples.
 The learning rate of the second training run should be small enough not
 to diverge from the unlabeled training configuration in too large steps
 (per iteration).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Training Iterations and Evaluations
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We trained for a pre-determined number of iterations (/deepnet/ setting
 /stopcondition.steps/ in train.pbtxt), often 1,000,000 iterations, and usually
 evaluated the neuronal network after every 500 iterations (/deepnet/ setting
 /eval_after/ in train.pbtxt).
 Evaluation means computing the training set, validation set, and testing
 set reconstruction error (in unsupervised training) or accuracy (in supervised
 training).
 The neuronal network itself was usually saved every 10,000 iterations (/deepnet
/ setting /checkpoint_after/ in train.pbtxt).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Model selection
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Because training an artificial neuronal network is an iterative process,
 there are as many models as there are iterations.
 The question is which one to choose.
 We did not use "early stopping", but selected the neuronal network that
 was best among all evaluated iterations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We normally did not use any model selection for the unsupervised training,
 since the reconstruction error plots of pre-training using auto-encoder
 or RBM did not show overfitting on the validation data set.
 Instead we selected the neuronal network from the last iteration that was
 computed.
\begin_inset Note Note
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
TODO: Insert here a reconstruction error plot from unsupervised learning.
 a validation data set for unsupervised training was defined for breast_cancer_1
2, see ~/nnet/notes/breast_cancer_12/reconstruction-error-*.
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We used model selection in training the (supervised) classifiers, because
 training a neuronal network for too many iterations using back-propagation
 has the tendency to overfit the training data and generalize poorly on
 the validation and test data.
 This means we defined three data sets: a training data set, which was used
 to iteratively train the neuronal network; a validation data set, which
 was used to pick the model (see below); a test data set, which was used
 to evaluate the accuracy of the neuronal network picked using the validation
 data set.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Usually model selection works by picking the neuronal network defined in
 the iteration with the highest validation data set accuracy.
 However, we sometimes had only few labeled samples in the validation data
 set.
 This led to a very coarse resolution in accuracy plots, and also to noisy
 validation data set accuracy plots, which often jittered (TODO: i want
 to say "wackelt") between two accuracies from one iteration to the next.
 We therefore smoothed each of the validation set accuracies, and test set
 accuracies using the standard R "loess" smoother with a span of 0.125.
 Then we selected the iteration where the smoothed validation set accuracy
 was highest, and reported the smoothed test set accuracy at that iteration.
 (TODO: insert example plot (with figure text) of loess smoothed accuracies,
 like in .../nnet/notes/breast_cancer_12/smoothed_accuracy-aa.png)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that this procedure allows reporting test set accuracies which seem
 impossible.
 For example in a test set with 10 members, only an accuracy in {0, 0.1,
 0.2, ..., 1} would seem possible, but smoothing allows all rational numbers
 between 0 and 1 to be returned as accuracy.

 It controls by what factor the gradient of each weight is multiplied with
 to influence the parameters of the neuronal network in the next iteration.
 If it is too large, the neuronal network will oscillate and make too large
 steps between iterations, so that it will not be able to ascend an energy
 optimum.
 If it is too small, learning will take too long.

Then the 10,000 most variable genes were determined.
 They were used as input genes, to halve computation time (from 22,283 genes).
 An RBM was trained, with 10,000 input nodes, and 50 hidden nodes.
 (Both layer's node types were gaussian.) The RBM was trained for about 70,000
 iterations.
 Training and testing data set reconstruction errors were still decreasing
 by small amounts each iteration.
 (The decreasing was stochastic, i.e.
 some iterations had slightly higher reconstruction error than the one of
 the iteration before, but on average, the reconstruction error of both
 training and test set decreased.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Although the 10,000 numbers were compressed into only 50 numbers, the mean
 reconstruction error of the 10,000 genes was only 0.33.
 Considering that microarray have log-intensities in [0;16], this is equivalent
 to a relative error of 2%.
 This demonstrated that RBMs are able to reduce dimensionality of a high-dimensi
onal data set while preserving most information.

breast_cancer_06: Increasing number of labeled samples
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
breast_cancer_06 defines several supervised learning samples which have
 less and less labeled training and test samples.
 This is to see if classifiers improve when using a pre-trained network
 using unlabeled samples over when they don't.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The smaller and smaller training data sets were defined by taking smaller
 and smaller fractions of the total 306 available labeled GSE25055 samples.
 The fractions were as displayed in table

Settings for the classifiers breast_cancer_04_aa - ad.
 Each classifier is initialized using an unsupervisedly pre-trained RBM,
 and trained supervisedly on data set breast_cancer_06.
 The only difference between the four configurations is the hidden layer
 1 size (
\begin_inset Formula $dimensions$
\end_inset

) and initialization (
\begin_inset Formula $pretrained\textrm{\_}model$
\end_inset

).
 No entry in a cell means that it has the same value as the cell to the

 Each panel shows one of the four configurations breast_cancer_06_aa - ad.
 In each panel, the x-axis shows the increasing numbers of labeled samples

\begin_layout Standard
Surprisingly, the neuronal network accuracies do not improve with increasing
 number of labeled samples.
 Instead it seems that the classifiers using the least and most (18 and
 302) samples perform best, and all others (especially those using 76 samples)
 perform worst.

\begin_layout Standard
However, when examining the predictions of model breast_cancer_06_aa/_n302_cv1
 (the first network pre-trained on 302 samples), it becomes evident that
 the training is sub-optimal, because label 0 is predicted almost exclusively.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The step at which the network performs best on the validation data set is
 95,500.

\begin_layout Standard
There is a heavy bias in favor of label 0.
 Our hypothesis was that this is due to the uneven class label distribution
 in data set breast_cancer_06.
 Therefore, the next data set was balanced in this regard.

\begin_layout Standard
To check whether the artificial neuronal networks work at all, we created
 a training data set that is composed of multiple labeled data sets with
 a decreasing number of labeled samples.
 In contrast to data set breast_cancer_06, each data set contains as many
 label 0 samples as label 1 samples.

\begin_layout Standard
Only the 500 most variable genes were used.
 The training and validation data sets are generated from subsets of GSE25055.
 Each training data set has an equal number of samples from class 0 and
 class 1.
 Due to there being only 57 label 1 samples in GSE25055, the validation
 data sets contain a larger number of class 0 samples, however.
 The test data set is composed of all GSE25065 samples.
 Each data set was drawn 5 times from the legal samples for the respective
 data set.
 This is to repeat the experiment 5 times and to be able to obtain error
 bars for the accuracies.

\begin_layout Standard
If we were to bet on the larger test set class we would achieve an accuracy
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $140/182=0.769$
\end_inset

, because the test set contains 140 label 0 samples, but only 42 label 1
 samples.
 However, because the training data set contains an equal number of label
 0 and label 1 samples, the test set accuracy should not be as biased as
 data set breast_cancer_06, whose training data set is imbalanced.

Settings for the classifiers breast_cancer_07_ai - aj.
 Each classifier is trained supervisedly on data set breast_cancer_07.
 The only difference between the two configurations is the use of

 in breast_cancer_07_ai.
 No entry in a cell means that it has the same value as the cell to the

The accuracy plots are shown in figure

.
 As can be seen, using 
\begin_inset Formula $dropout$
\end_inset

 in breast_cancer_07_ai yields better accuracies than not using it in in
 breast_cancer_07_aj.
 In addition, comparing (e.g.
 breast_cancer_07_ai) with the neuronal networks pre-trained using RBM or
 auto-encoder (e.g.
 breast_cancer_07_ag) seems to indicate a slight advantage of not using
 pre-training (but using dropout) in the data sets with little labeled samples.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As seen in the above sections, the accuracies of the classifiers on breast_cance
r_07 are lower than those on breast_cancer_06, indicating the higher difficulty
 of the classification task when the labels are balanced.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Examining the output of breast_cancer_07_aa/_n090_cv1
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Like for breast_cancer_06, we looked at the output of one of the neuronal
 networks trained on data set breast_cancer_07.
 As can be seen in table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:predictions-of-breast_cancer_07_aa"

\end_inset

 and in contrast to the predictions on data set breast_cancer_06, the predicted
 classes are now more balanced.

\begin_layout Standard
A confusion table was made on the predictions on the testing data set.
 It shows that most predicted label 1 samples are actually label 0 samples
 (

Histogram of probabilities of samples predicted wrongly by breast_cancer_07_aa/_

The histogram shows that the probabilities for the true class of mis-classified

breast_cancer_08: Different normalizations
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The data set breast_cancer_08 was created to search for normalizations that
 are beneficial to pre-training and classification.
 To achieve that goal, GSE25055 and GSE25065 build data sets with a constant
 number of labeled samples and an increasing number of unlabeled samples.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:design-of-breast_cancer_08"

\end_inset

 shows the assignment of samples to data sets.
 Note that labeled training and validation data are exclusively from GSE25055,
 and labeled testing data are exclusively from GSE25065.
 Labeled training and testing data are balanced with respect to the number
 of label 0 and label 1 samples.
 If a data set were unbalanced, this would lead to a biased classifier which
 prefers the label it was shown more often during training.
 (See 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "par:Examining-biased-classifier"

\end_inset

.) The increasing number of unlabeled training data are mostly from GSE25055,
 except data set 4, which also has unlabeled data from GSE25065.
 The unlabeled training data are balanced in data sets 1 and 2, and in proportio
ns 1:2 and 1:4 in data sets 3 and 4, respectively.

\begin_layout Standard
Normalization methods were RMA (TODO: cite), MAS5 (TODO: cite), RMA+ComBat,
 MAS5+ComBat.
 ComBat (TODO: cite) was designed as a batch-effect correction method.
 This means it tries to produce a data set with the same size as the original
 one, but with a possible batch-effect between samples removed.
 As input, ComBat needs the expression matrix and, for each sample, the
 batch it was measured in.

Reconstruction error for differently normalized data.
 In the rows are the different normalizations, and in the columns the data
 sets.
 Each cell in the table contains mean or standard deviation of the reconstructio
n error.
 The numbers are rounded to two significant digits.
 MAS5 normalization is indicated by italic font style, and COMBAT batch
 effect correction is in the lower half of the table.
 (TODO: transpose this table, otherwise it doesn't fit on paper.)

\begin_layout Plain Layout
TODO: check that deepnet does divide reconstruction error by the number
 of samples used in unsupervised training, and, if so, write a sentence
 stating that fact here.
 Otherwise, write a sentence that the increasing reconstruction errors probably
 derive from increased number of samples.
\end_layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The MAS5 normalizations all have lower reconstruction errors than their
 RMA counterpart with same concomitant normalization steps (vertically alternati
ng high and low mean).
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
The standard deviation of the reconstruction errors across replicates (i.e.
 with different unlabeled data) is consistently smaller for MAS5 than for
 RMA.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Additional COMBAT batch effect correction does not seem to alter the reconstruct
ion error of RMA or MAS5 normalized data.
\end_layout

There is no clear trend in the table above how COMBAT influences standard
 deviation (across replications) of reconstruction errors.

Mean accuracies for each normalization and data set in breast_cancer_08.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It shows the following:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
rma-data.pbtxt (i.e.
 without Combat pre-processing) out-performs all other tested combinations
 of normalization method and pre-processing in all data sets tested.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
RMA seems to perform consistently better than MAS5 (an exception is data
 set 3 with Combat pre-processing).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Using Combat as pre-processing leads to worse accuracies on the RMA-normalized
 data, but improves accuracies when using MAS5 (except in data set 3).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
ZCA normalization
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We also tried applying ZCA normalization after all 4 normalizations tried
 above.
 This step helped in face recognition, for example (TODO: cite the (a bit
 older, maybe from 1999?) paper from Toronto).
 However, for our data set it resulted in random classifiers, i.e.
 their accuracies were around 0.5.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(TODO: write what ZCA does in images (contrast enhacement?) and hypothesize
 why this does not help in expression data.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Does adding unlabeled samples help in semi-supervised neuronal network training?

 None of the plots show a clear increasing accuracy from data set 1 to data
 set 4.
 However, the silhouettes of the box-plots of

\end_inset

 means, for each data set, the interval from the accuracy of the repetition
 with lowest to the accuracy of the repetition with highest accuracy; or
 differently, the maximal outliers.
 In addition, the median of the accuracies of data set 1 is greater than
 the median of the accuracies of both data set 3 and 4, for every normalization.
 The fact that the median of the accuracies of data set 2 is not always
 greater than the median of the accuracies of data set 1 could be due to
 randomness in data subsampling when creating the 5 repetitions.
 Another reason could be that only 28 additional unlabeled samples (
\begin_inset Formula $29-15=14$
\end_inset

 label 0 samples, and 14 label 1 samples) are not enough to lead to a better
 pre-trained classifier.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A flaw in the design of the data sets of breast_cancer_08 is that the number
 of label 0 and label 1 samples is not balanced.
 This is due to the class imbalance in GSE25055 and GSE25065.
 The next data set breast_cancer_12 thus has balanced classes in the unlabeled
 training samples.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
breast_cancer_12: data set design
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Following the same arguments as in creating data set breast_cancer_08, we
 aimed for the following properties.
 All training/validation data sets should have an equal number of 0/1 samples,
 otherwise deepnet's predictions are biased towards the larger group.
 Samples used in the unlabeled training/validation data set are also used
 for labeled training/validation, otherwise there are not enough samples.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are the following differences between breast_cancer_12 and breast_cancer_0
8.
 breast_cancer_12 includes an unlabeled validation data set: the purpose
 is to be able to early-stop pre-training, which is necessary for learning
 multiple hidden layers in a DBN.
 The normalization is only RMA (without ComBat), because it performed best
 in data set breast_cancer_08.
 There are 20 repetitions for each data set.
 The repetitions are made by selecting the samples at random from the eligible
 samples.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The labeled samples are held constant across all 6 data sets within one
 repetition.
 This is to be able to directly compare performance e.g.
 between data set 1 and 3.
 The difference between data set 1 and 3 is only the unlabeled pre-training.

\end_inset

In data set breast_cancer_12, there are always 42|42 testing samples.
 There is no overlap between UT (unlabeled training), UV (unlabeled validation),
 LT (labeled training), and LV (labeled validation) samples.
 The number of labeled samples is held constant at 20|20 across data sets.
 The number of training and validation samples is almost equal in each data
 set (the difference is at most 1, for the unlabeled data).
 The number of unlabeled samples is increased linearly from 0|0 (0|0 in
 GSE25055 and 0|0 in GSE25065) to the maximum number of remaining samples
 50|50 (29|29 in GSE25055 and 21|21 in GSE25065).
 The labeled data are equal across all data sets (but different between
 different repetitions).

Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 describes the 6 data sets of breast_cancer_12.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
DBN training
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
breast_cancer_12_aa - dv is like breast_cancer_08_jh, except that in pre-trainin
g the hidden layers, it uses the model performing best on the validation
 data, not the model of the last training iteration.
 This is possible because there is an unlabeled validation data set in breast_ca
ncer_12.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The architecture of the DBNs is 500-1000-1000-2000-1, that means the input
 layer has 500 nodes for the 500 most significant genes, then there are
 three hidden layers with sizes 1000, 1000, and 2000, and the output layer
 has 1 node, that outputs the probability that the input sample has label
 1.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We reduced the unsupervised learning rate from 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

base_epsilon: 0.01
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to 0.001, and increase 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

sparsity_damping: 0.9
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to 0.99 in layer 2 and 3.
 We do this because otherwise these layers have their best model on the
 labeled validation data set very early in training, and sometimes 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

explode
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (i.e.
 their parameters and reconstruction error oscillate).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another difference is that the supervised learning rate in breast_cancer_12_aa
 - dv is 0.0001, not 0.001.
 (TODO: cite "Srivastava Salakhutdinov 2014 dropout.pdf") says in section
 5.2 that when choosing the learning rate smaller than the best learning
 rate for randomly initialized nets, the information in the pretrained weights
 seem to be retained, and finetuning improves the final generalization error
 compared to not using dropout when finetuning.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We also changed 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

eval_after: 500
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to 100 in train_supervised.pbtxt, in order to check more often for the optimal
 solution, because supervised training sometimes finds the best model on
 the validation data set very early in training.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
TSVM: Use both training and validation data sets for training
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To predict using TSVM, for every repetition and every data set, we joined
 labeled training, labeled validation data, unlabeled training, and unlabeled
 validation data to the training input file to be used by TSVM.
 This is because deepnet also has access to these labeled and unlabeled
 samples.
 The testing data set is equivalent to that for deepnet.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The default settings for TSVM were used.
 In particular, the command lines were similar to the following:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Verbatim
echo "learning model"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Verbatim
svm_learn ./input.txt model.model

Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Accuracy-comparison-of-breast_cancer_12"

\end_inset

 shows that there is no clear improvement by increasing the number of unlabeled
 samples, when using neither a DBN, nor a TSVM.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This can be quantified using a paired and two-sided Wilcoxon test.
 It is paired over the repetitions because the labeled training and validation
 sets are constant across data sets 1-6 within a repetition and the only
 difference is the amount of unlabeled data used during training.
 It is two-sided because we do not know before the experiment which data
 set will perform better than another.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By experiment we mean the predictions that are stored in the accuracies
 in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Accuracy-comparison-of-breast_cancer_12"

\end_inset

 when keeping constant the prediction method and sub-data-set of breast_cancer_1
2, but varying the repetition.
 This means there are 1 FFN, 5 DBN, 1 SVM, and 6 TSVM experiments.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We could now compare all experiments against all other experiments using
 a Wilcoxon test.
 However, this would be 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

fishing for significance
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, and we would have to correct the significances for multiple testing.
 If comparing all against all, there are 
\begin_inset Formula $(1+5+1+6)^{2}=169$
\end_inset

 comparisons, and we would lose a lot of power due to comparisons that are
 not interesting.
 That is why we only compare the experiments in figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Accuracy-comparison-of-breast_cancer_12"

\end_inset

 row-wise and column-wise, because these comparisons allow an interpretation.
 That way there are only 
\begin_inset Formula $(1*5)+(1*6)+(1*1)+(5*6)=42$
\end_inset

 comparisons.
 We adjust the p-values within each comparison only.

\begin_layout Standard
Due to their p-values being 0.011, the TSVM on data set 1 is significantly
 better than the DBN on all data sets.
 In addition, the SVM on data set 2 is significantly better than the DBN
 on data set 3.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The result that the TSVM is better than the DBN on data set 1, and not on
 data set 5 or 6, which consist of more unlabeled data, is contrary to the
 expected hypothesis that a semi-supervised TSVM on more unlabeled samples
 is better than one on less unlabeled samples.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Comparison TSVM versus TSVM
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The largest differences in prediction accuracy are within TSVM.
 Due to it being semi-supervised we are interested whether there are significant
 accuracy differences within the sub-data-sets of breast_cancer_12.

 Again, this is contrary to the expected hypothesis that adding unlabeled

breast_cancer_15: higher ratio of training numbers to network parameters
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since breast_cancer_12 has a negative result in summary, we designed data
 set breast_cancer_15 by considering the differences in data sources and
 artificial neuronal network configurations between our and the ones in
 image recognition, where DBNs are successful.

 weights.

Section 6 shows the pattern recognition performance of a network with three
 hidden layers and about 1.7 million weights on the MNIST set of handwritten
 digits.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

) We believe they used 44000 training samples (
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

The network shown in Figure 1 was trained on 44,000 of the training images
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

) with 28*28 pixels each (their Figure 1: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

28 x 28 pixel image
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

).
 So altogether they have about 34.5 million 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

training numbers
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, and 1.7 million weights that have to be determined.
 Precisely, their ratio of input numbers to weights is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\frac{\mbox{input numbers}}{\mbox{weights}} & = & \frac{44000*28*28}{28*28*500+500*500+500*2000+2000*10}\approx20.8
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

.

have an architecture of 500-1000-1000-2000-1 (500 input nodes, 1000 hidden
 layer 1 nodes, 1000 hidden layer 2 nodes, 2000 hidden layer 3 nodes, and
 1 output layer node).
 This means there are 
\begin_inset Formula $500*1000+1000*1000+1000*2000+2000*1\approx3.5*10^{6}$
\end_inset

 weights to be learnt.
 The ratio of 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\mbox{input numbers}}{\mbox{weights}}\approx0.034$
\end_inset

 is much lower in our case than in the image recognition case.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This can be changed by using all 
\begin_inset Formula $i=22,283$
\end_inset

 genes as inputs, and only a very small number of hidden nodes 
\begin_inset Formula $h$
\end_inset

.
 If we take 
\begin_inset Formula $i=22283$
\end_inset

, and there are 238 training samples (in fact we have only 20 labeled plus
 100 unlabeled training samples in data set breast_cancer_12), then we have
 
\begin_inset Formula $22,283*238=5,303,354$
\end_inset

 measured numbers.
 If we also wanted a ratio as in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "HintonTeh2006"

\end_inset

.
 Then the ratio 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
r(h) & = & \frac{22283*238}{22283*h+h*h+h*h+h*o}
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $h$
\end_inset

 is the number of hidden nodes and 
\begin_inset Formula $o$
\end_inset

 is the number of output samples and is equal to 1, because the labeled
 cases have a binary label.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
breast_cancer_15: data set design
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To exclude the possibility that a batch effect between GSE25055 and GSE25065
 ruins semi-supervised learning, in breast_cancer_15 we only use GSE25055
 and again want 10|10 labeled training and validation samples.
 This leaves us with remaining 
\begin_inset Formula $57-20=37$
\end_inset

 label 1 samples for testing, and also use 37 label 0 samples.
 Like in previous data sets, all samples for the labeled training and validation
 data sets can be re-used in the unlabeled data set, because the labels
 are not given to the neural network during pre-training.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We choose a reasonably large unlabeled validation data set of 28 samples
 like in breast_cancer_12 (although in breast_cancer_12 we used 21 GSE25065
 samples in addition).
 The ratio of label 0 to label 1 samples is 
\begin_inset Formula $249/57\approx4.37$
\end_inset

.
 To have a sufficient number of label 1 unlabeled validation samples, we
 use 100|25 (where 
\begin_inset Formula $x|y$
\end_inset

 means 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 label 0 samples and 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

 label 1 samples) unlabeled validation samples, where the 25 label 1 samples
 are replicated 4 times.
 This leaves 
\begin_inset Formula $57-25=32$
\end_inset

 label 1 samples for the unlabeled training data set.
 Replicating label 1 samples 4 times in the data set to have the same ratio
 of different label 0 and label 1 samples as in the unlabeled validation
 data set gives 
\begin_inset Formula $128|32*4=128|128$
\end_inset

 samples.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Altogether, there are in the labeled and unlabeled training data 
\begin_inset Formula $10|10+128|32*4=138|138$
\end_inset

 samples = 276 samples, when counting the quadrupled label 1 samples as
 individual samples.
 When counting the quadrupled samples as only 1 real sample, there are 
\begin_inset Formula $10|10+128|32=10*2+128+32=180$
\end_inset

 samples.
 So 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{quad}=276$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{indiv}=180$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $o=1$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The ratio is then 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
r(h,t) & = & \frac{22283*t}{22283*h+h*h+h*h+h*o}
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

.
 For the 6 different data sets, and 
\begin_inset Formula $h=10$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $r(h,t)$
\end_inset

 is:

 6 sub-data-sets are created, with the first one having no unlabeled data
 at all, the last one having 
\begin_inset Formula $128|32*4$
\end_inset

 training and 
\begin_inset Formula $100|25*4$
\end_inset

 validation samples, and interpolated numbers in-between.
 The labeled data are equal across all data sets (but different between
 different repetitions).
 There are 20 sub-sampling repeats per sub-data-set.
 All samples are from GSE25055, to avoid a possible batch-effect.
