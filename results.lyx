Treatment Sensitivity Prediction for Personalized Medicine
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The goal of personalized medicine is to provide custom-tailored medicine
 to every patient.
 An essential part of this is to select an appropriate treatment for a specific
 patient out of the available treatments.
 The treatment should have a high probability of succeeding.
 One way of approaching this is through machine learning on the expression
 data from a patients tissue to predict the treatment outcome.
 Such a prediction requires similar expression data from multiple patients
 that already underwent the treatment in question and where the therapy
 outcome is known.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Therefore we wanted to find a data set that had something to do with drug
 sensitivity and resistance.

 The ones having a match were sorted by the number of samples in the data
 set because deep neuronal network learning seems to require big data sets,
 and we have to split samples into a training, validation, and test data
 set.
 We read the abstracts of this list, starting from the top.

 The authors used GSE25055 to generate a classifier for the prognosis of
 breast cancer patients that received reductive surgery followed by taxane-anthr

 All patients had ERBB2 (also called HER2 or HER2/neu)-negative breast cancer.
 The tissue extracted in reductive surgery was measured on Affymetrix HG-U133A
 microarrays.
 After a mean of 3 years, the patients were labeled as either showing

More sophisticated prediction schemes can be imagined so that the prediction
 made produces more than one number: For example, in addition to the severity
 of the disease after therapy (a number between 0 and 1), the number of
 metastases (a natural number) could be trained and predicted.
 Such a prediction is not made in this work, because only little clinical
 data was recorded in the used data set.
 However, in the neuronal network it would be straightforward to predict
 such two numbers by adding an additional (properly scaled) number to the
 output layer in the training set.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
to assess performance of the classifier on an independently measured data

 Parallel to these, the performance of a semi-supervised version of Support
 Vector Machines, namely the Transductive SVM was evaluated.

One label was on a data set whose prediction reached an accuracy (of about
 75%) that is equal to the accuracy reached by betting on the larger group
 (see ~/uni-publication/progress_report_201411/progress_report_20141118.pdf),
 and one label didn't work, that is, it did not enhance the classifiers'
 accuracies.

\begin_layout Standard
As we will see, only the very last attempts with artificial neuronal networks
 showed partially that adding unlabeled data in training leads to better
 classifiers.
 This is also true for the established semi-supervised TSVM, which only
 showed improvement for the last attempts when adding unlabeled data to
 training.
 We therefore believe that it is mainly a property of the data set whether
 a semi-supervised machine learning algorithm can benefit from unlabelled
 data.

 is a neuronal network implementation written by Nitish Srivastava, which
 uses a matrix library (called cudamat) written by Vlad Mnih and Alex Krizhevsky.
 It can run on graphics cards (supporting CUDA).
 Due to graphics cards having a highly parallel architecture, this means
 faster training times.
 However, because graphics cards have to process large data, their RAM is
 more expensive than normal RAM for PCs.
 The graphics cards in the Regensburg Athene cluster computers have 4 GB
 of RAM installed.
 Because 
\emph on
deepnet
\emph default
 loads all data sets at the beginning of the computation onto the graphics
 card, this means that the data sets may not be larger than 4 GB.
 However, there is another matrix library (called eigenmat and with the
 same interface as cudamat), which runs on the normal floating-point unit
 of a normal CPU.
 There was a bug in this library when run on 64-bit CPUs, which we fixed

 Classification was done on the compressed representation of the input.
 The classifier network was built on top of the encoder, and the compressed

How Unlabeled Data was Used When Pre-training a Restricted Boltzmann Machine

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When using the unsupervised Restricted Boltzmann Machine to find the approximate
 weights of a neuronal network, the unlabeled data were used to train the
 Restricted Boltzmann Machine.
 The resulting neuronal network was then extended with the network layer
 for supervised classification, and the complete network was trained using
 (supervised) back-propagation on the labeled data.

\begin_layout Standard
As was said in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

, Deep Belief Networks are an unsupervised algorithm and thus were trained
 using unlabeled data.
 As with Restricted Boltzmann Machines, the resulting network was then extended
 with the classifier layer, and the complete network was fine-tuned using
 back-propagation on the labeled data.

\begin_layout Subsection
Training Iterations and Evaluations
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We trained both the unsupervised as well as the supervised network for a
 pre-determined number of iterations.
 This number was determined by a trial run on one data set, so that the
 improvement of the neuronal network was only marginal at the end.
 There were usually between 100,000 and 1,000,000 iterations (
\emph on
deepnet

s (

 Evaluation means computing the training set, validation set, and testing
 set reconstruction error (in unsupervised training) or accuracy (in supervised
 training).
 The neuronal network itself was saved every 10,000 iterations (

 Computing 1,000,000 (supervised) back-propagation iterations of the same

 The parameters that the running time mainly depends on are the network
 architecture, the learning rate, and number of training iterations.

Model Selection
\begin_inset CommandInset label

name "sub:Model-selection"

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Because training an artificial neuronal network is an iterative process,
 there are as many models as there are iterations.
 The question is which one to choose.
 We did not use 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

early stopping
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand vref
reference "sub:Early-stopping"

\end_inset

), but selected the neuronal network that was best on the validation data
 among all evaluated iterations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We normally did not use any model selection for the unsupervised training,
 since the reconstruction error plots of pre-training using autoencoder
 or RBM did not show overfitting on the validation data set.
 Instead we selected the neuronal network from the last iteration that was
 computed.
 An example of the plot can be seen in figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand vref
reference "fig:reconstruction-errors-of-breast_cancer_04_bg-bj"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We used model selection in training the (supervised) classifiers, because
 training a neuronal network for too many iterations using back-propagation
 has the tendency to overfit the training data and generalize poorly on
 the validation and test data.
 This means we defined three data sets: a training data set, which was used
 to iteratively train the neuronal network; a validation data set, which
 was used to pick the model (see below); and a test data set, which was
 used to evaluate the accuracy of the neuronal network picked using the
 validation data set.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Usually model selection works by picking the neuronal network defined in
 the iteration with the highest validation data set accuracy.
 However, we sometimes had only few (in the tens) labeled samples in the
 validation data set.
 This led to a very coarse resolution in accuracy plots, and also to noisy

 We therefore smoothed each of the validation set accuracies, and test set
 accuracies using the standard R

 smoother with a span of 0.125.
 Then we selected the iteration where the smoothed validation set accuracy
 was highest, and reported the smoothed test set accuracy at that iteration.
 (If there were more than one iterations that had the highest validation
 set accuracy, we reported the mean and the median of the smoothed test
 set accuracies at these iterations, and plotted all these accuracies in
 a box plot

Example of supervised model selection.
 The x-axis is the training iteration, the y-axis the accuracy.
 The turquoise, green, and black circle clouds are the raw accuracies on
 the training, validation, and test set, respectively.
 They are in discrete steps, because there are few samples.
 The thin lines overlayed on the point clouds are the 
\emph on
loess 
\emph default
smoothed curves used for model selection.
 The dashed vertical line is the iteration where the accuracy on the validation
 data set is maximal, and the model at that iteration was selected.

\begin_layout Standard
Note that this procedure allows reporting test set accuracies which seem
 impossible.
 For example in a test set with 10 samples, only an accuracy in {0, 0.1,
 0.2, ..., 1} would be possible, but smoothing allows all rational numbers between
 0 and 1 to be returned as accuracy.

 It controls by what factor the gradient of each weight is multiplied with
 to influence the parameters of the neuronal network in the next iteration.
 If it is too large, the neuronal network will alter weights in too large
 steps and oscillate, and will not be able to reach an energy optimum.
 If it is too small, learning will take too long.

 In this case, 0.01 was a good tradeoff between accuracy and training speed.

RBM Parameters and Its Reconstruction Error

\end_inset

.
 The RBM was trained for about 70,000 iterations.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The reconstruction error was computed after each iteration.
 The reconstructed value of a visible node is obtained by initializing the
 visible layer with the original data, computing the hidden layer's nodes
 from the visible layer, computing the visible layer from the hidden layer's
 nodes, and these values are the reconstructed values.
 The reconstruction error of a visible node is the euclidean distance between
 its original value in the data set and the visible node's reconstructed
 value.
 The reconstruction error is a measure of how well a network can compress
 visible data in the hidden layer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the last of the fixed number of iterations, training and testing data
 set reconstruction errors were still decreasing by small amounts each iteration.
 (The decreasing was stochastic, i.e.
 some iterations had slightly higher reconstruction error than the one of
 the iteration before, but on average, the reconstruction error of both
 training and test set decreased.)

Left: True (x-axis) versus reconstructed (y-axis) expression values of data
 set breast_cancer_0.
 The heatmap shows pixels from red over yellow to white.
 A pixel in red means zero genes and in white means many genes that have
 the pixel's true and reconstructed expression value.
 Right: Boxplot of reconstruction errors of the 10,000 most variable genes.
 Most genes have a very low reconstruction error.

\begin_layout Standard
Although the 10,000 numbers were compressed into only 50 numbers, the mean
 reconstruction error of the 10,000 genes was only 0.563.
 Considering that the possible range (log2-intensities) of microarray values
 is in [0;16], this is equivalent to a relative error of 3.5%.
 This demonstrated that RBMs are able to reduce dimensionality of an expression
 data set while preserving most information.

Increasing Number of Labeled Samples (breast_cancer_06)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The goal of breast_cancer_06 was to verify if basic training works.
 This was verified by testing whether the classifier improves with an increasing
 amount of labeled samples.
 Therefore we trained using all unlabeled samples, and defined supervised
 learning data sets which have less and less labeled training and test samples.
 Models were pre-trained using either an RBM or autoencoder and fine-tuned
 with supervised back-propagation.

 Samples from GSE17705 were included to give unsupervised training access
 to more samples.
 (In later experiments, GSE17705 was left out to increase the probability
 that samples are from the same distribution.)

Unsupervised Pre-training Using RBM (breast_cancer_04_bg - bj)

\begin_layout Standard
For unsupervised pre-training of the RBM, we tried different configurations
 that are denoted in table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:deepnet-settings-for-breast_cancer_04_bg-bj"

\end_inset

.
 (They were re-used from the runs labeled breast_cancer_04, which are not
 described here.) The reconstruction errors observed at the input layer during
 training are shown in figure

reference "fig:reconstruction-errors-of-breast_cancer_04_bg-bj"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Of note in this plot is that there is no overfitting since training reconstructi
on error does not rise at the end of training.
 Also note that reconstruction error is not normalized to the number of
 samples.

Settings for the classifiers breast_cancer_04_aa - ad.
 Each classifier is initialized using an unsupervisedly pre-trained RBM,
 and trained supervisedly on data set breast_cancer_06.
 No entry in a cell means that it has the same value as the cell to the
 left.
 The only difference between the four configurations is the hidden layer
 1 size (
\begin_inset Formula $dimensions$
\end_inset

) and initialization (
\begin_inset Formula $pretrained\textrm{\_}model$
\end_inset

).

 differently pre-trained RBMs, a classifier was trained.
 (So altogether

 Each panel shows one of the four configurations breast_cancer_06_aa - ad.
 In each panel, the x-axis shows the number of labeled samples in the 5
 different data sets.
 The y-axis shows the smoothed accuracy, as described in section

 Each dot is the accuracy of a repetition in the respective data set.

\begin_layout Standard
Surprisingly, the neuronal network accuracies do not improve with increasing
 number of labeled samples.
 Instead it seems that the classifiers using the least and most (18 and
 302) samples perform best, and all others (especially those using 76 samples)
 perform worst.
 As we will see in section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:Increasing-number-of-labeled-samples-and-equal-number-of-class-labels-breast_cancer_07"

\end_inset

, this is due to an unbalanced number of label 0 and label 1 samples in
 the training set.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We also tried using 2 hidden layers instead of 1.
 This did not improve accuracy.

Supervised Classification with Unsupervised Pre-trained Autoencoder (breast_canc

\begin_layout Standard
When training a neuronal network using back-propagation that was pre-trained
 using one of the four autoencoders described in the previous section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:Unsupervised-pre-training-using-autoencoder-(breast_cancer_03_ai,_al,_am,_ao)"

\end_inset

, the resulting accuracy plots looked similar to the ones when pre-training
 with an RBM (plots not shown).
 As we will see in section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:Increasing-number-of-labeled-samples-and-equal-number-of-class-labels-breast_cancer_07"

\end_inset

, similar to pre-training using RBMs, this is due to an uneven number of
 label 0 and label 1 samples in the training set.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Like for RBMs, we also tried using 2 hidden layers instead of 1, but this
 did not improve accuracy.

\begin_layout Standard
When examining the predictions of model breast_cancer_06_aa/_n302_cv1 (the
 first network pre-trained on 302 samples), it becomes evident that the
 training is sub-optimal, because label 0 is predicted almost exclusively.

\begin_layout Standard
Only the 500 most variable genes were used.
 The training and validation data sets were generated from subsets of GSE25055.
 Each training data set had an equal number of samples from class 0 and
 class 1.
 However, the validation data sets contained a larger number of class 0
 samples, because there were only 57 label 1 samples in GSE25055, and 45
 of them were needed for training.
 The test data set is composed of all GSE25065 samples.
 Each data set was drawn 5 times from the samples as described for training
 and validation data set.
 This is to repeat the experiment 5 times and to be able to obtain error
 bars for the accuracies.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If we were to bet on the larger test set class we would achieve an accuracy
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $140/182=0.769$
\end_inset

, because the test set contains 140 label 0 samples, but only 42 label 1
 samples.
 However, because the training data set contains an equal number of label
 0 and label 1 samples, the test set accuracy should not be as biased as
 data set breast_cancer_06, whose training data set is imbalanced.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The following machine learning algorithms were tested on this data set:
 SVM, TSVM, supervised classification with unsupervised pre-trained RBM,
 supervised classification with unsupervised pre-trained autoencoder, supervised

 Figure

 shows that TSVM sometimes fails to learn a model for the data sets with
 less than 46 labeled samples and otherwise performs similarly to a normal
 SVM.

 As can be seen, using 
\begin_inset Formula $dropout$
\end_inset

 in breast_cancer_07_ai yields better accuracies than not using it in in
 breast_cancer_07_aj.
 Recall from section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:Dropout"

\end_inset

 that 
\emph on

\begin_inset Formula $dropout$
\end_inset


\emph default
 reduces overfitting.
 In addition, comparing with the neuronal networks pre-trained using RBM
 or autoencoder (e.g.
 breast_cancer_07_ai versus breast_cancer_07_ag) might indicate a slight
 advantage of not using pre-training (but using 
\begin_inset Formula $dropout$
\end_inset

) in the data sets with little labeled samples.
 However, this assertion should be re-done with more than 5 repetitions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As seen in the above sections, the accuracies of the classifiers on breast_cance
r_07 are lower than those on breast_cancer_06, indicating the higher difficulty
 of the classification task when the labels are balanced.
 We will look into this in the following.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

 networks trained on data set breast_cancer_07.
 As can be seen in table

\end_inset

 and in contrast to the predictions on data set breast_cancer_06, the predicted

We made a confusion table on the predictions in the testing data set.
 It shows that most predicted label 1 samples are actually label 0 samples
 (
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{39}{39+26}$
\end_inset

).
 Of the true label 0 samples, 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{101}{101+39}\approx0.72$
\end_inset

 are classified correctly, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{26}{26+16}\approx0.62$
\end_inset

 of the true label 1 samples.
 This may indicate that predicting label 1 samples, which means

The predicted probabilities of the true class of the mis-classified samples

 The histogram shows that the probabilities for the true class of mis-classified
 samples are not mostly near 0.5, but in the middle of the possible range.
 (0.5 is the maximum probability, otherwise the sample would not be mis-classifie

Different Normalizations (breast_cancer_08)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One of the goals of this work was to show that adding unlabeled samples
 increases accuracy in semi-supervised classification.
 To achieve that goal, in breast_cancer_08, we built data sets with a constant
 number of labeled samples and an increasing number of unlabeled samples.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To alleviate the effects of systematic errors in the raw data, we tried
 different normalizations in order to search for normalizations that are
 beneficial to classification accuracy.
 We assessed the effect of different normalizations on unsupervised pre-training
 and supervised classification accuracy.

 shows the assignment of samples to data sets.
 Note that labeled training and validation data are exclusively from GSE25055,
 and labeled testing data are exclusively from GSE25065.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Labeled training and testing data are balanced with respect to the number
 of label 0 and label 1 samples.
 If a data set were unbalanced, this would lead to a biased classifier which
 prefers the label it was shown more often during training.
 (See 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "par:Examining-biased-classifier"

\end_inset

.) The increasing number of unlabeled training data are mostly from GSE25055,
 except data set 4, which also has unlabeled data from GSE25065.
 The unlabeled training data are balanced in data sets 1 and 2, and in proportio
ns 1:2 and 1:4 in data sets 3 and 4, respectively.

 Because MAS5 does not logarithmize the data, but RMA does, MAS5 was tried
 with additional logarithmizing of the data.
 ComBat was designed as a batch-effect correction method.
 This means it tries to produce a data set with the same size as the original
 one, but with a possible batch-effect between samples removed.
 As input, ComBat needs the expression matrix and, for each sample, the
 batch number it was measured in.

Reconstruction error for differently normalized data.
 In the rows are the different normalizations, and in the columns the data
 sets.
 Each cell in the table contains mean(and standard deviation in brackets)
 of the reconstruction error.
 The numbers are rounded to two significant digits.

Before looking at the accuracies of the supervised classifier, we looked
 at unsupervised pre-training using an autoencoder.
 The reconstruction error for each normalization is shown in table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

reference "tab:Reconstruction-error-for-breast_cancer_08"

\end_inset

 Of note in this table are the following:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The reconstruction error becomes higher the more unlabeled data there are.
 
\begin_inset Note Note
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
TODO: check that deepnet does divide reconstruction error by the number
 of samples used in unsupervised training, and, if so, write a sentence
 stating that fact here.
 Otherwise, write a sentence that the increasing reconstruction errors probably
 derive from increased number of samples.
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The MAS5 normalizations all have lower reconstruction errors than their
 RMA counterpart with same concomitant normalization steps (vertically alternati
ng high and low mean).
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
The standard deviation of the reconstruction errors across replicates (i.e.
 with different unlabeled data) is consistently smaller for MAS5 than for
 RMA.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Additional COMBAT batch effect correction does not seem to alter the reconstruct
ion error of RMA or MAS5 normalized data.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
There is no clear trend in the table above how COMBAT influences standard
 deviation (across replications) of reconstruction errors.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
Although it may seem beneficial to achieve a low reconstruction error as
 possible, we will see that a better (lower) reconstruction error does not
 necessarily translate into a better (higher) accuracy.

\begin_layout Standard
It shows the following:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
RMA alone (i.e.
 without Combat pre-processing) out-performs all other tested combinations
 of normalization method and pre-processing in all data sets tested.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
RMA seems to perform consistently better than MAS5 (an exception is data
 set 3 with Combat pre-processing).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Using Combat as pre-processing leads to worse accuracies on the RMA-normalized
 data, but improves accuracies when using MAS5 (except in data set 3).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Taking the log2 of MAS5-normalized data only improves accuracies when the
 data is ComBat pre-processed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
ZCA Normalization
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We also tried applying ZCA normalization after all 4 normalizations tried
 above.
 This step helped in face recognition, for example 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "KrizhevskyHinton2009"

\end_inset

.
 However, for our data set it resulted in random classifiers, i.e.
 their accuracies were around 0.5.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Note Note
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
On second thought, ZCA whitening is non-sensical in expression data since
 it is a linear transformation on the whole expression matrix.
 It can be seen as creating artificial features by linearly combining genes
 such that TODO.
 Those genes may not have anything in common

 means, for each data set, the interval from the accuracy of the repetition
 with lowest to the accuracy of the repetition with highest accuracy; or
 differently, the maximal outliers.
 In addition, the median of the accuracies of data set 1 is greater than
 the median of the accuracies of both data set 3 and 4, for every normalization.
 The fact that the median of the accuracies of data set 2 is not always
 greater than the median of the accuracies of data set 1 could be due to
 randomness in data subsampling when creating the 5 repetitions.
 Another reason could be that only 28 additional unlabeled samples (
\begin_inset Formula $29-15=14$
\end_inset

 label 0 samples, and 14 label 1 samples) are not enough to lead to a better
 pre-trained classifier.

(breast_cancer_12)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A flaw in the design of the data sets of breast_cancer_08 is that the number
 of label 0 and label 1 samples is not balanced.
 This is due to the class imbalance in GSE25055 and GSE25065.
 The next data set breast_cancer_12 thus had balanced classes in the unlabeled
 training samples.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To see a possible rise in accuracy with a rising number of unlabled samples,
 we also increased the number of sub-sampling repetitions.
 In addition, instead of using autoencoder or RBM for pre-training, we pre-train
ed a Deep Belief Network.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Data Set Design
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Following the same arguments as in creating data set breast_cancer_08, we
 aimed for the following properties.
 All training/validation data sets should have an equal number of 0/1 samples,
 otherwise 
\emph on
deepnet
\emph default
's predictions are biased towards the larger group.
 Samples used in the unlabeled training/validation data set were also used
 for labeled training/validation, otherwise there are not enough samples.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are the following differences between breast_cancer_12 and breast_cancer_0
8.
 breast_cancer_12 includes an unlabeled validation data set whose purpose
 is to be able to early-stop pre-training, which was necessary for learning
 multiple hidden layers in a DBN.
 The only normalization used was RMA (without ComBat), because it performed
 best in data set breast_cancer_08.
 There are 20 instead of 5 repetitions for each data set.
 Again the sub-sampling repetitions were made by selecting the samples at
 random from the eligible samples.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The labeled samples were held constant across all 6 data sets within one
 repetition.
 This is to be able to directly compare performance between e.g.
 data sets 1 and 3 within a repetition.
 The only difference between data sets 1 and 3 is the unlabeled pre-training
 data.

 labeled validation samples.
 The number of labeled samples is held constant at 20|20 (10|10 for training
 and validation) across data sets.
 The number of training and validation samples is almost equal in each data
 set (the difference is at most 1, for the unlabeled data).
 The number of unlabeled samples is increased linearly from 0|0 (0|0 in
 GSE25055 and 0|0 in GSE25065) to the maximum number of remaining samples
 50|50 (29|29 in GSE25055 and 21|21 in GSE25065).
 The labeled data are equal across all data sets (but different between
 different repetitions).

\begin_layout Subsection
DBN Training
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
breast_cancer_12_aa - dv is like breast_cancer_08_jh, except that in pre-trainin
g the hidden layers, it uses the model performing best on the validation
 data, not the model of the last training iteration.
 This is possible because there is an unlabeled validation data set in breast_ca
ncer_12.
 In addition, instead of using RBMs or autoencoders, DBNs were used for
 pre-training.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The architecture of the DBNs was 500-1000-1000-2000-1, that means the input
 layer has 500 nodes for the 500 most significant genes, then there are
 three hidden layers with sizes 1000, 1000, and 2000, and the output layer
 has 1 node which outputs the probability that the input sample has label
 1.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We reduced the unsupervised learning rate from 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

base_epsilon: 0.01
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to 0.001, and increased 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

sparsity_damping: 0.9
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to 0.99 in layer 2 and 3.
 We do this because otherwise these layers have their best model on the
 labeled validation data set very early in training, and sometimes 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

explode
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (i.e.
 their parameters and reconstruction error oscillate).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another difference is that the supervised learning rate in breast_cancer_12_aa
 - dv is 0.0001, not 0.001.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "SrivastavaSalakhutdinov2014"

\end_inset

 says in section 5.2 that when choosing the learning rate smaller than the
 best learning rate for randomly initialized nets, the information in the
 pretrained weights seems to be retained, and finetuning improves the final
 generalization error compared to not using dropout when finetuning.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We also changed 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

eval_after: 500
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to 100 in train_supervised.pbtxt, in order to check more often for the optimal
 solution, because supervised training sometimes finds the best model on
 the validation data set very early in training.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Because Deep Belief Networks need unlabeled samples during pre-training,
 data set 1, which does not contain unlabeled samples, cannot be used to
 train DBNs.
 Therefore the DBNs were only trained on data sets 2 to 6.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Using Both Training and Validation Data Sets for Training TSVMs
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To predict using TSVM, for every repetition and every data set, we joined
 labeled training, labeled validation data, unlabeled training, and unlabeled
 validation data to the training input file to be used by TSVM.
 This was done because deepnet also has access to these labeled and unlabeled
 samples.
 The testing data set was the same as that used for the neuronal networks.

Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Accuracy-comparison-of-breast_cancer_12"

\end_inset

 shows that there is no clear improvement by increasing the number of unlabeled
 samples, neither when using a DBN, nor a TSVM.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This can be quantified using a paired and two-sided Wilcoxon test.
 It is paired over the repetitions because the labeled training and validation
 sets are constant across data sets 1-6 within a repetition and the only
 difference is the amount of unlabeled data used during training.
 It is two-sided because we do not know before the experiment which algorithm
 on a data set will perform better than another.
 The null hypothesis is that the true accuracy shift between the two compared
 experiments is zero.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By experiment we mean the predictions that are stored in the accuracies
 in figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Accuracy-comparison-of-breast_cancer_12"

\end_inset

 when keeping the prediction method and sub-data-set of breast_cancer_12
 constant, but varying the repetition.
 This means there are 1 FFN, 5 DBN, 1 SVM, and 6 TSVM experiments.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We could now compare all experiments against all other experiments using
 a Wilcoxon test.
 However, this would be 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

fishing for significance
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, and we would have to correct the p-values for multiple testing.
 If comparing all against all, there are 
\begin_inset Formula $(1+5+1+6)*(1+5+1+6-1)/2=78$
\end_inset

 comparisons, and we would lose a lot of power due to comparisons that are
 not interesting.
 That is why we only compare the experiments in figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Accuracy-comparison-of-breast_cancer_12"

\end_inset

 row-wise and column-wise, because these comparisons allow an interpretation.
 That way there are only 
\begin_inset Formula $1*5+1*6+1*1+5*6=42$
\end_inset

 comparisons.
 We adjust the p-values within each comparison only.

 Because the FFN is trained supervisedly, it cannot be trained on data sets

\begin_layout Standard
Due to their p-values being smaller than 5%, we can conclude that the TSVM
 on data set 1 is significantly better than the DBN on all data sets.
 In addition, the SVM on data set 2 is significantly better than the DBN
 on data set 3.
 For example, the TSVM trained on sub-data-set 1 is better than the DBN
 trained on sub-data-set 2 by 2.3 percent points in accuracy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The result that the TSVM on data set 1 is better than the DBNs, and not
 on data set 5 or 6, which consist of more unlabeled data, is contrary to
 the expected hypothesis that a semi-supervised TSVM trained on more unlabeled
 samples is better than one on less unlabeled samples.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The table also shows that the advantage of using a TSVM over a DBN becomes
 negligible when adding more unlabeled data to training.
 (The

 value declines with increasing data set, from 2.0% on data set 2 versus
 data set 2 to 0.1% on data set 6 versus data set 6.)

Comparison of TSVM Versus TSVM
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The largest differences in prediction accuracy are within TSVM.
 Due to it being semi-supervised we were interested in whether there are
 significant accuracy differences within the sub-data-sets of breast_cancer_12.

The lowest adjusted p-value is 0.098 between data set 1 and data set 6.
 Again, this is contrary to the expected hypothesis that adding unlabeled
 data in the training of the semi-supervised TSVM is beneficial to its predictio
n accuracy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Less Network Parameters (breast_cancer_15)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since breast_cancer_12 has a negative result in summary, because it cannot
 confirm the benefit of adding unlabled samples to training, in data set
 breast_cancer_15 we considered the differences in data sources and artificial
 neuronal network configurations between our and the ones in image recognition,
 where DBNs are successful.

\end_inset

Section 6 shows the pattern recognition performance of a network with three
 hidden layers and about 1.7 million weights on the MNIST set of handwritten
 digits.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

) They used 44000 training samples (
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

The network shown in Figure 1 was trained on 44,000 of the training images
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

) with 28*28 pixels each (their Figure 1: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

).
 So altogether they have about 34.5 million 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

training numbers
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, and 1.7 million weights that have to be determined.
 Precisely, their ratio of input numbers to number of weights is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\frac{\mbox{input numbers}}{\mbox{weights}} & = & \frac{44000*28*28}{28*28*500+500*500+500*2000+2000*10}\approx20.8
\end{eqnarray*}

have an architecture of 500-1000-1000-2000-1 (500 input nodes, 1000 hidden
 layer 1 nodes, 1000 hidden layer 2 nodes, 2000 hidden layer 3 nodes, and
 1 output layer node).
 This means there are 
\begin_inset Formula $500*1000+1000*1000+1000*2000+2000*1\approx3.5*10^{6}$
\end_inset

 weights to be learnt.
 The ratio of 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\mbox{input numbers}}{\mbox{weights}}\approx0.034$
\end_inset

 is much lower in our case than in the image recognition case.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This can be changed by using all 
\begin_inset Formula $i=22,283$
\end_inset

 genes as inputs, and only a very small number of hidden nodes 
\begin_inset Formula $h$
\end_inset

.
 If we take 
\begin_inset Formula $i=22283$
\end_inset

, and there are 238 training samples (in fact we have only 20 labeled plus
 100 unlabeled training samples in breast_cancer_12), then we have 
\begin_inset Formula $22,283*238=5,303,354$
\end_inset

 measured numbers.
 If we also wanted a similar ratio to 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet

\end_inset

.
 Then the ratio is
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
r(h) & = & \frac{22283*238}{22283*h+h*h+h*h+h*o}
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $h$
\end_inset

 is the number of hidden nodes and 
\begin_inset Formula $o$
\end_inset

 is the number of output samples and is equal to 1, because the labeled
 cases have a binary label.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Data Set Design
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To exclude the possibility that a batch effect between GSE25055 and GSE25065
 ruins semi-supervised learning, in breast_cancer_15 we only use GSE25055
 and again we use 10|10 labeled training and validation samples.
 This leaves us with remaining 
\begin_inset Formula $57-20=37$
\end_inset

 label 1 samples for testing, and we also use 37 label 0 samples.
 Like in previous data sets, all samples for the labeled training and validation
 data sets can be re-used in the unlabeled data set, because the labels
 are not given to the neuronal network during pre-training.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We choose a reasonably large unlabeled validation data set of 28 samples
 like in breast_cancer_12 (although in breast_cancer_12 we used 21 GSE25065
 samples in addition).
 The ratio of label 0 to label 1 samples is 
\begin_inset Formula $249/57\approx4.37$
\end_inset

.
 To have a sufficient number of label 1 unlabeled validation samples, we
 use 
\begin_inset Formula $100|25$
\end_inset

 (where 
\begin_inset Formula $x|y$
\end_inset

 means 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 label 0 samples and 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

 label 1 samples) unlabeled validation samples, where the 25 label 1 samples
 are replicated 4 times (written 
\begin_inset Formula $100|25*4$
\end_inset

).
 This leaves 
\begin_inset Formula $57-25=32$
\end_inset

 label 1 samples for the unlabeled training data set.
 Replicating label 1 samples 4 times in the data set to have the same ratio
 of different label 0 and label 1 samples as in the unlabeled validation
 data set gives 
\begin_inset Formula $128|32*4=128|128$
\end_inset

 samples.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Altogether, there are in the labeled and unlabeled training data 
\begin_inset Formula $10|10+128|32*4=138|138$
\end_inset

 samples = 276 samples, when counting the quadrupled label 1 samples as

Different Training Parameters
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In comparison to breast_cancer_12, the unsupervised learning rate (
\emph on
base_epsilon
\emph default
) was decreased from 0.01 to 0.001 for the pre-training of hidden layer 1,
 and from 0.001 to 0.0001 for pre-training hidden layers 2 and 3.
 We also changed the batch size from 100 to 1000, which is more inefficient,
 but iterates over all training samples before changing weights, and thus
 approximates the derivative of the weights more faithfully.

Box plots of test set accuracies for different data sets with more and more
 unlabeled training samples in breast_cancer_15.
 The x-axis are the data sets (except data set 1, which cannot be used in
 DBNs because it does not contain unlabeled data) in the order of rising
 number of unlabeled samples.
 The y-axis is the accuracy.
 Each dot represents the accuracy on a repetition.

\begin_layout Standard
Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Accuracy-in-breast_cancer_15"

\end_inset

 shows the accuracies obtained for data set breast_cancer_15.
 The accuracies are better than those obtained in breast_cancer_12: The
 median accuracy is near 0.7 for all data sets except data set 3, while it
 was slightly above 0.65 in breast_cancer_12.
 This may be due to less overfitting because there are less model parameters,
 but it may also be due to the training having used more input data (22,283
 genes instead of the 500 most significant).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To check whether there is a dependence of accuracies on the amount of unlabeled
 samples available to training, we use a paired (over the repetitions) and
 two-sided Wilcoxon test (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:Comparison-of-Neuronal-Networks-with-Support-Vector-Machines"

\end_inset

).
 The p-value for the accuracy difference between data sets 2 and 6 is 8.9%,
 which some people consider significant.
 The estimated difference between accuracies of data sets 2 and 6 is 2.8
 percent points.
 (The 95% confidence interval for the difference is [-0.46; 6.7] percent points.)
 Depending on what one considers significant, this shows a dependence of
 accuracy on the number of unlabeled samples.

A TSVM was trained on the training and validation data of each repetition
 of all data sets in breast_cancer_15.
 Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Accuracy-box-plots-of-breast_cancer_15"

\end_inset

 shows the accuracies on the test sets.
 Training failed in data set 2.
 Except for data set 2, one can see a slight accuracy increase from data
 set 1 to data set 6, i.e.
 from the data set with the no unlabeled samples to the data set with the
 most unlabeled samples.
 Following the same rationale as in section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:Comparison-of-Neuronal-Networks-with-Support-Vector-Machines"

\end_inset

, the accuracy difference between data sets 1 and 6 was tested for significance
 with a paired (over the repetitions) and two-sided Wilcoxon test.
 It is significant with a p-value of 0.29%, and the accuracy difference between
 data 1 and 6 is an estimated 3.38 percent points, while its 95% confidence
 interval is [2.02; 6.08].
 This means that in breast_cancer_15, TSVM succeeded in increasing accuracy
 slightly by learning from unlabeled samples.

\begin_layout Standard
When training a TSVM only on the training data (but leaving away the validation
 data), in addition to data set 2, also data set 3 fails to train a proper
 model with almost all their accuracies at 0.5, and data set 4 has a median
 accuracy of only

0.575 (data not shown).
 This may show that semi-supervised training using a TSVM fails when not
 a sufficient number of unlabeled training samples is available.
