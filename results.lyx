Reasons for choosing GSE25055 and GSE25065 as the data set
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Originally I wanted to find a data set that had something to do with drug
 sensitivity and resistance.
 Therefore a GEO (TODO: cite GEO) database search was conducted.
 All data sets uploaded to GEO between January 1st 2000, and August 31st
 2013 were considered and searched for 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

sensitiv
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

resist
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 The ones having a match in title or abstract were sorted by the number
 of samples in the data set.
 GSE25055 and GSE25065 were among those that really had something to do
 with drug sensitivity and had a relatively high sample count.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
GSE25055 and GSE25065 are data sets produced for the same paper, namely
 (TODO: cite the GEO25055 paper, I think it is by Hatzis et al.).
 In this paper, GSE25055 was used to generate a classifier for the prognosis
 of breast cancer patients that received reductive surgery followed by taxane-an
thracycline chemotherapy.
 All patients had ERBB2 (HER2 or HER2/neu)-negative breast cancer.
 The tissue extracted in reductive surgery was measured on Affymetrix HG-U133A
 microarrays.
 After a mean of 3 years, the patients were labeled as either showing pathologic
 complete response (
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

pCR
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

; class 1; there was no sign of a remaining breast cancer) to chemotherapy
 or residual disease (
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

RD
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

; class 0; there was still cancerous tissue).
 The classifier was then tested on an independently measured data set, GSE25065.
 The classifier's performance was tested based on (TODO: review something
 about the results of the GSE25055 paper by Hatzis & Symmans).

Goal of this work
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The goals of this work were: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
to find out whether incorporating unlabeled expression data in the training
 of deep artificial neuronal networks enhances a classifier's performance.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
to assess performance of the classifier on an independently measured data
 set.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Two types of neuronal networks that lend themselves for semi-supervised
 training were used: auto-encoders and deep belief networks.
 Parallel to these, the performance of a semi-supervised version of Support
 Vector Machines, namely the Transductive SVM was evaluated.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Four normalization methods were tried: two microarray normalization methods
 were tried: Robust Multi-Chip Average (RMA) (TODO: cite), MAS5 (TODO: cite).
 These were tried without or with subsequent ComBat (TODO: cite) batch-effect
 correction.
 Two prediction goals were tried: (TODO: look up the exact labels that were
 used for prediction.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Note Note
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
One label was on a data set whose prediction reached an accuracy (of about
 75%) that is equal to the accuracy reached by betting on the larger group
 (see ~/uni-publication/progress_report_201411/progress_report_20141118.pdf),
 and one label didn't work, that is, it did not enhance the classifiers'
 accuracies.
 (see ~/uni-publication/progress_report_201507/presentation-20150707.pdf)).
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As we will see, none of the attempts with artificial neuronal networks showed
 that adding unlabeled data in training leads to better classifiers.
 However, also TSVM did not show improvement when adding unlabeled data
 to training.
 I therefore think that it is probably the fault of the data set.
 Contrary to the data sets (hand-written digit classification and graphical
 object recognition) on which the discussed artificial neuronal networks
 were developed, and on which they are among the best-performing predictors,
 expression data sets have sizes which are several magnitudes smaller.
 This is probably due to the price of microarrays (and RNASeq), which is
 magnitudes larger than the price to take pictures of hand-written digits
 or objects.

\begin_layout Paragraph
Issues in running 
\emph on
deepnet
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
deepnet
\emph default
 (TODO: cite) is a neuronal network implementation written by Nitish Srivastava
 and uses a matrix library written by Krishevski (TODO: oder so).
 It can run on NVIDIA graphics cards supporting CUDA.
 Due to graphics cards having a highly parallel architecture, this means
 faster training times.
 However, because graphics cards have to process large data, their RAM is
 more expensive than normal RAM for PCs.
 In the Regensburg Athene NVIDIA computers, there are 4 GB of RAM installed.
 Because 
\emph on
deepnet
\emph default
 loads all data sets at the beginning of computation onto the graphics card,
 this means that the data sets may not be larger than 4 GB.However, as mentioned,
 the matrix library can also run on the normal floating-point unit of normal
 PC.
 There was a bug in 
\emph on
deepnet
\emph default
 when run on 64-bit processors, which I fixed.
 (TODO: include the bugfix here).
 Most of the data sets were trained on rhskl11, which has 128GB of RAM (TODO:
 or 256GB?), which was more than enough for the data sets tested.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
How unlabeled data was used in training Auto-Encoders
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Because auto-encoders
\begin_inset Index idx
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
auto-encoders
\end_layout

\end_inset

 are composed of an encoder
\begin_inset Index idx
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
encoder
\end_layout

\end_inset

 and a decoder
\begin_inset Index idx
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
decoder
\end_layout

\end_inset

 and the encoder tries to compress the input data and the decoder tries
 to reconstruct the input from its compressed form, training them is unsupervise
d.
 The unlabeled data are therefore handled like the labeled data, because
 the label is unused in training the autoencoder.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The decoder network of the trained autoencoder was then thrown away, so
 that only the encoder remained.
 Classification was done on the compressed respresentation of the input.
 The classifier network was built on top of the encoder, and the compressed
 output layer of the encoder was connected to the input layer of the classifier.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(TODO: Bild wie unten auf Slide 7 von ~/uni-publication/progress_report_201411/p
rogress_report_20141118.pdf einfügen.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The weights of the classifier were initialized randomly, and standard back-propa
gtion was used to train the whole network to classify samples.
 This means that the encoder can be modified by back-propagation training,
 but pre-training with the auto-encoder initializes it to a configuration
 that 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

knows
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 about the unlabeled samples.
 The learning rate of the second training run should be small enough not
 to diverge from the unlabeled training configuration in too large steps
 (per iteration).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Training Iterations and Evaluations
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We trained for a pre-determined number of iterations (/deepnet/ setting
 /stopcondition.steps/ in train.pbtxt), often 1,000,000 iterations, and usually
 evaluated the neuronal network after every 500 iterations (/deepnet/ setting
 /eval_after/ in train.pbtxt).
 Evaluation means computing the training set, validation set, and testing
 set reconstruction error (in unsupervised training) or accuracy (in supervised
 training).
 The neuronal network itself was usually saved every 10,000 iterations (/deepnet
/ setting /checkpoint_after/ in train.pbtxt).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Model selection
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Because training an artificial neuronal network is an iterative process,
 there are as many models as there are iterations.
 The question is which one to choose.
 We did not use "early stopping", but selected the neuronal network that
 was best among all evaluated iterations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We normally did not use any model selection for the unsupervised training,
 since the reconstruction error plots of pre-training using auto-encoder
 or RBM did not show overfitting on the validation data set.
 Instead we selected the neuronal network from the last iteration that was
 computed.
\begin_inset Note Note
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
TODO: Insert here a reconstruction error plot from unsupervised learning.
 a validation data set for unsupervised training was defined for breast_cancer_1
2, see ~/nnet/notes/breast_cancer_12/reconstruction-error-*.
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We used model selection in training the (supervised) classifiers, because
 training a neuronal network for too many iterations using back-propagation
 has the tendency to overfit the training data and generalize poorly on
 the validation and test data.
 This means we defined three data sets: a training data set, which was used
 to iteratively train the neuronal network; a validation data set, which
 was used to pick the model (see below); a test data set, which was used
 to evaluate the accuracy of the neuronal network picked using the validation
 data set.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Usually model selection works by picking the neuronal network defined in
 the iteration with the highest validation data set accuracy.
 However, we sometimes had only few labeled samples in the validation data
 set.
 This led to a very coarse resolution in accuracy plots, and also to noisy
 validation data set accuracy plots, which often jittered (TODO: i want
 to say "wackelt") between two accuracies from one iteration to the next.
 We therefore smoothed each of the validation set accuracies, and test set
 accuracies using the standard R "loess" smoother with a span of 0.125.
 Then we selected the iteration where the smoothed validation set accuracy
 was highest, and reported the smoothed test set accuracy at that iteration.
 (TODO: insert example plot (with figure text) of loess smoothed accuracies,
 like in .../nnet/notes/breast_cancer_12/smoothed_accuracy-aa.png)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that this procedure allows reporting test set accuracies which seem
 impossible.
 For example in a test set with 10 members, only an accuracy in {0, 0.1,
 0.2, ..., 1} would seem possible, but smoothing allows all rational numbers
 between 0 and 1 to be returned as accuracy.

 It controls by what factor the gradient of each weight is multiplied with
 to influence the parameters of the neuronal network in the next iteration.
 If it is too large, the neuronal network will oscillate and make too large
 steps between iterations, so that it will not be able to ascend an energy
 optimum.
 If it is too small, learning will take too long.

\begin_layout Standard
Then the 10,000 most variable genes were determined.
 They were used as input genes, to halve computation time (from 22,283 genes).
 An RBM was trained, with 10,000 input nodes, and 50 hidden nodes.
 (Both layer's node types were gaussian.) The RBM was trained for about 70,000
 iterations.
 Training and testing data set reconstruction errors were still decreasing
 by small amounts each iteration.
 (The decreasing was stochastic, i.e.
 some iterations had slightly higher reconstruction error than the one of
 the iteration before, but on average, the reconstruction error of both
 training and test set decreased.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Although the 10,000 numbers were compressed into only 50 numbers, the mean
 reconstruction error of the 10,000 genes was only 0.563.
 This demonstrated that RBMs are able to reduce dimensionality of a high-dimensi
onal data set while preserving most information.

breast_cancer_06: Increasing number of labeled samples
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
breast_cancer_06 defines several supervised learning samples which have
 less and less labeled training and test samples.
 This is to see if classifiers improve when using a pre-trained network
 using unlabeled samples over when they don't.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The smaller and smaller training data sets were defined by taking smaller
 and smaller fractions of the total 306 available labeled GSE25055 samples.
 The fractions were as displayed in table

Settings for the classifiers breast_cancer_04_aa - ad.
 Each classifier is initialized using an unsupervisedly pre-trained RBM,
 and trained supervisedly on data set breast_cancer_06.
 The only difference between the four configurations is the hidden layer
 1 size (
\begin_inset Formula $dimensions$
\end_inset

) and initialization (
\begin_inset Formula $pretrained\textrm{\_}model$
\end_inset

).
 No entry in a cell means that it has the same value as the cell to the

 Each panel shows one of the four configurations breast_cancer_06_aa - ad.
 In each panel, the x-axis shows the increasing numbers of labeled samples

\begin_layout Standard
Surprisingly, the neuronal network accuracies do not improve with increasing
 number of labeled samples.
 Instead it seems that the classifiers using the least and most (18 and
 302) samples perform best, and all others (especially those using 76 samples)
 perform worst.

\begin_layout Standard
However, when examining the predictions of model breast_cancer_06_aa/_n302_cv1
 (the first network pre-trained on 302 samples), it becomes evident that
 the training is sub-optimal, because label 0 is predicted almost exclusively.

There is a heavy bias in favor of label 0.

To check whether the artificial neuronal networks work at all, we created

 In contrast to data set breast_cancer_06, each data set contains as many

\begin_layout Standard
Only the 500 most variable genes were used.
 The training and validation data sets are generated from subsets of GSE25055.
 Each training data set has an equal number of samples from class 0 and
 class 1.
 Due to there being only 57 label 1 samples in GSE25055, the validation
 data sets contain a larger number of class 0 samples, however.
 The test data set is composed of all GSE25065 samples.
 Each data set was drawn 5 times from the legal samples for the respective
 data set.
 This is to repeat the experiment 5 times and to be able to obtain error
 bars for the accuracies.

\begin_layout Standard
If we were to bet on the larger test set class we would achieve an accuracy
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $140/182=0.769$

, because the test set contains 140 label 0 samples, but only 42 label 1
 samples.
 However, because the training data set contains an equal number of label
 0 and label 1 samples, the test set accuracy should not be as biased as
 data set breast_cancer_06, whose training data set is imbalanced.

Accuracy bar plots of feed-forward neuronal networks not pre-trained, predicting
 the testing data set of breast_cancer_07.
 On the x-axis are the sizes of the data sets containing an increasing number
 of labeled samples.
 On the y-axis are the accuracies obtained on the testing data.

\begin_layout Standard
The accuracy plots are shown in figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Accuracy-bar-plots-of-breast_cancer_07_ai-aj"

\end_inset

.
 As can be seen, using 
\begin_inset Formula $dropout$
\end_inset

 in breast_cancer_07_ai yields better accuracies than not using it in in
 breast_cancer_07_aj.
 In addition, comparing (e.g.
 breast_cancer_07_ai) with the neuronal networks pre-trained using RBM or
 auto-encoder (e.g.
 breast_cancer_07_ag) seems to indicate a slight advantage of not using
 pre-training (but using dropout) in the data sets with little labeled samples.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As seen in the above sections, the accuracies of the classifiers on breast_cance
r_07 are lower than those on breast_cancer_06, indicating the higher difficulty
 of the classification task when the labels are balanced.

\begin_layout Paragraph

\begin_layout Standard
Like for breast_cancer_06, we looked at the output of one of the neuronal
 networks trained on data set breast_cancer_07.
 As can be seen in table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

reference "tab:predictions-of-breast_cancer_07_aa"

\end_inset

 and in contrast to the predictions on data set breast_cancer_06, the predicted

 The x-axis is the predicted probability of the true class; the y-axis the
 counts of genes.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The histogram shows that the probabilities for the true class of mis-classified
 samples are not mostly near 0.5, but in the middle of the possible range.
 (0.5 is the maximum probability, otherwise the sample would not be mis-classifie
d.)

breast_cancer_08: Different normalizations
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The data set breast_cancer_08 was created to search for normalizations that
 are beneficial to pre-training and classification.
 To achieve that goal, GSE25055 and GSE25065 build data sets with a constant
 number of labeled samples and an increasing number of unlabeled samples.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:design-of-breast_cancer_08"

\end_inset

 shows the assignment of samples to data sets.
 Note that labeled training and validation data are exclusively from GSE25055,
 and labeled testing data are exclusively from GSE25065.
 Labeled training and testing data are balanced with respect to the number
 of label 0 and label 1 samples.
 If a data set were unbalanced, this would lead to a biased classifier which
 prefers the label it was shown more often during training.
 (See 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "par:Examining-biased-classifier"

\end_inset

.) The increasing number of unlabeled training data are mostly from GSE25055,
 except data set 4, which also has unlabeled data from GSE25065.
 The unlabeled training data are balanced in data sets 1 and 2, and in proportio
ns 1:2 and 1:4 in data sets 3 and 4, respectively.

Normalizations

\begin_layout Standard
Normalization methods were RMA (TODO: cite), MAS5 (TODO: cite), RMA+ComBat,
 MAS5+ComBat.
 ComBat (TODO: cite) was designed as a batch-effect correction method.
 This means it tries to produce a data set with the same size as the original
 one, but with a possible batch-effect between samples removed.
 As input, ComBat needs the expression matrix and, for each sample, the
 batch it was measured in.
 (TODO: stimmt das? ist die Beschreibung vollständig?) Table
