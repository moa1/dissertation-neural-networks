 could represent the random variables 
\begin_inset Formula $\{X_{1},X_{2},X_{3}\}$

Generative and Discriminative Models

 is: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

If you possess a restricted amount of information for solving some problem,
 try to solve the problem directly and never solve a more general problem
 as an intermediate step.
 It is possible that the available information is sufficient for a direct
 solution but is insufficient for solving a more general intermediate problem.

\begin_layout Standard
A generative model
\begin_inset Index idx

\begin_layout Plain Layout
generative model
\end_layout

\end_inset

 is such a more general problem: its aim is to model the input data set
 such that hypothetical samples can be generated from the model which might
 as well be found in the original input data set.
 A discriminative model
\begin_inset Index idx

\begin_layout Plain Layout
discriminative model
\end_layout

\end_inset

 on the other hand receives the input samples and models the desired output
 values from these input samples.
 Usually the desired output values have much lower dimension than the input
 samples.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Restricted Boltzmann Machines and Deep Belief Networks are both generative
 models.
 On the other hand, a neural network trained only with back-propagation
 is a discriminative model.
 In a discriminative model, the possible values of the parameters (weights)
 are constrained by the information it takes to specify the class label
 of a training sample.
 In a generative model, however, the parameters need to encode the whole
 sample, and are therefore constrained by the information it takes to encode
 the training sample.
 The number of bits required to specify the class label is usually much
 smaller than the number of bits required to specify a whole training sample

When learning generative models of high-dimensional data, however, it is
 the number of bits that it takes to specify a data vector that determines
 how much constraint each training case imposes on the parameters of the
 model.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another advantage of a generative model is that one can draw samples from
 its distribution (
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\end_inset

) to easily find out what the model has learned.
 Due to their greater generality, generative models have the disadvantage
 that they are slower than discriminative models.

 eroded by Moore's Law.

Definition of Graphical Models
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Graphical models are an encoding of a factorizable joint probability distributio
n with the help of a graph.
 There are different types of graphical models, but there are defining elements
 of all graphical models.
 Each node of the graph corresponds to a random variable of the joint probabilit
y distribution.
 The edges of the graph encode the conditional probability distributions.
 The graph, together with probability functions over the structural elements
 of the graph is equivalent to the joint probability distribution.

\begin_inset Formula

\end{eqnarray}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the general case (if the joint probability cannot be factorized), this
 nested sum needs 
\begin_inset Formula $O(|\mathbf{u}|^{|\mathbf{U}|})=O(|\mathbf{u}|^{n})$
\end_inset

 operations to compute, where 
\begin_inset Formula $|\mathbf{u}|$
\end_inset

 is the number of possible values a variable 
\begin_inset Formula $U_{i}$
\end_inset

 can have (assuming for simplicity that all random variables 
\begin_inset Formula $U_{i}$
\end_inset

 have the same number of possible values 
\begin_inset Formula $|\mathbf{u}|$
\end_inset

) and 
\begin_inset Formula $|\mathbf{U}|$
\end_inset

 is the number of unknown variables 
\begin_inset Formula $U_{i}$
\end_inset

 This is because all possible combinations of variable assignments have
 to be considered.
 Thus, for this naive marginalization run-time is exponential in the number
 of variables, and therefore intractable.

In the case of an undirected graphical model, this can be improved by factorizin
g the joint probability into independent sub-joint-probabilities, if possible.
 For example, if the random variables 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{U}=\{U_{1},U_{2},\dots,U_{m}\}$
\end_inset

 are composed of cliques 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{C_{1}},\mathbf{C_{2}},\dots,\mathbf{C_{n}}$

\begin_inset Formula $P(\mathbf{U})=\frac{1}{Z}\phi_{1}(\mathbf{C_{1}})\phi_{2}(\mathbf{C_{2}})\dots\phi_{n}(\mathbf{C_{n}})$
\end_inset

, then the above sum can be written, using Hammersley-Clifford, as
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
 & P(\mathbf{W}=\mathbf{w}|\mathbf{K}=\mathbf{k})\\
= & \sum_{U_{1}}\sum_{U_{2}}\cdots\sum_{U_{n}}\frac{P(\mathbf{W}=\mathbf{w},U_{1}=u_{1},U_{2}=u_{2},\dots,U_{n}=u_{n},\mathbf{K}=\mathbf{k})}{P(\mathbf{K}=\mathbf{k})}\\

The sums in the last line are nested sums that sum over all possible states
 in the corresponding cluster.
 (If we order cliques descendingly by the number of clique members then
 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{C_{1}}$

 is the largest clique.) Because we still need to sum over the state combinations
 in the largest clique, this means that the run-time is at least 
\begin_inset Formula $O(|\mathbf{u}|^{|\mathbf{C_{m}}|})$
\end_inset

When the probability distribution of the parent nodes are known, inferring
 the probability distributions of child nodes is easy: just multiply the
 probability of the parents with the conditional probability of the child.
 To keep the example interesting, given the probability distributions of
 the nodes in the bottom layer, we want to infer the probability distributions
 for all the other nodes.
 We want to determine the exact probability distributions, hence the term

 While having detailed balance implies that a Markov chain has a stationary
 distribution, the reverse is not true: there are Markov chains with a stationar
y distribution but not satisfying detailed balance.
 (For example, a Markov chain with transition probabilities

 Its goal is to generate samples from a multivariate joint probability distribut

 The generated samples can then be used to compute an approximation of the

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To use a Gibbs Sampler, one must construct a Markov chain with its (only)
 stationary distribution equal to the target distribution.
 Because its goal is to sample from a multivariate probability distribution,
 each of the random variables are updated in turn, based on the conditional
 probabilities.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Gibbs Sampling Requires Closed-form Conditional Probabilities
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This means that a precondition to being able to use a Gibbs Sampler is that
 the following conditional probabilities of the target distribution are
 known, so that they can be evaluated.
 Suppose that the multivariate target distribution is 
\begin_inset Formula $P(X_{1},\dots,X_{n})$
\end_inset

.
 Then for each random variable 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{i}\in\{X_{1},\dots,X_{n}\}$
\end_inset

 the conditional probability of the variable given all other variables must
 be known in closed form: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
P(X_{i}\mid\mathbf{X_{j}},j\in\{1,\dots,n\}\backslash i)=P(X_{i}\mid X_{1},\dots,X_{i-1},X_{i+1},X_{n}).
\]

\end_inset

(Another prerequisite is that Gibbs Sampling, which requires sampling from
 the conditional probability distribution and iterating, should be faster
 than sampling from the joint target probability distribution directly.
 We already showed in section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 that exact inference is infeasible in Deep Belief Networks.)

\begin_layout Paragraph
A Markov Chain in Multiple Dimensions

\begin_layout Standard
The variable updates in Gibbs sampling can be regarded as a Markov chain.
 However, we must first define how the random variables of Gibbs sampling
 are mapped to the random variable of the Markov chain.
 One theoretic possibility is to re-map the random variables and their states
 to a single random variable.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Above, Markov chains were defined for a single state variable 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

 But in Gibbs sampling there are usually more than one variable, written
 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{i}\in\{X_{1},\dots,X_{n}\}$
\end_inset

 If there are a finite number of random variables in Gibbs sampling, i.e.,
 if 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 is finite, and the state space of these variables is also finite, say of
 size 
\begin_inset Formula $m$

 the returned samples, which prevent them from being used in those applications

 The samples of two adjacent time steps

We start the Gibbs sampling procedure by fixing the observed variables to
 their known values, and setting the unobserved variables arbitrarily.
 We then repeatedly visit each unobserved variable in turn, each time randomly
 selecting a new value for the variable from its conditional distribution
 given the current values of the other variables.
 From the joint distribution of equation (2.15), we see that the conditional
 distribution for X k is as follows:

\begin_layout Paragraph
Comparison of Gibbs Sampling in Markov Random Fields and Bayesian Networks
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Gibbs Sampling in Markov Random Fields is easier than Gibbs Sampling in
 directed graphical models.
 This is because the conditional probability distributions needed for Gibbs
 Sampling are simpler than those in Bayesian Networks.
 The conditional probability distribution needed in Gibbs Sampling was given
 in equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand vref
reference "eq:Gibbs sampling: CPD"

\end_inset

.
 This conditional probability is particularly simple for Markov Random Fields,
 because of the local Markov property (refer to section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand vref
reference "local-Markov-property"

\end_inset

): each random variable 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{i}$
\end_inset

 is independent of all other random variables given the states of the neighborin
g random variables.
 This means that in Markov Random Fields, the conditional probability (see
 equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:Gibbs sampling: CPD"

\end_inset

) is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
P(X_{i}\mid X_{1},\dots,X_{i-1},X_{i+1},\dots,X_{n})=P(X_{i}\mid\mathbf{X}_{Neighborhood(X_{i})}).
\]

\end_inset

For comparison, in Bayesian Networks the conditional probability would be
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
P(X_{i}\mid X_{1},\dots,X_{i-1},X_{i+1},\dots,X_{n})=P(X_{i}\mid\mathbf{X}_{MarkovBlanket(X_{i})}),
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{X}_{MarkovBlanket(X_{i})}$
\end_inset

 are the random variables in the Markov Blanket of 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{i}$
\end_inset

.
 The Markov Blanket of a random variable is more complicated to compute
 than its neighborhood.
 The Markov Blanket of a random variable 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

 is the set of its parents and children, and its children's parents.

\begin_inset Index idx

 is that in a deterministic network a node represents a single value, while
 in a stochastic network a single node represents a probability distribution.
 In particular, if there is a set of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 nodes, then in a deterministic setting the output can be interpreted as
 a single point in a high-dimensional space, while in a stochastic network
 the output is the joint probability distribution over all the random variables
 associated with the output nodes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A stochastic network is more general than its deterministic counterpart,
 since a stochastic network can be converted to a deterministic network,
 but not vice-versa.
 This greater generality comes at a higher cost, however, since inference
 and learning in stochastic networks take longer than the computation of
 the output and the learning in deterministic networks.

Difficulties in Training Multi-layer Neural Networks
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Training a randomly initialized feed-forward neural network with more than
 1 hidden layer using back-propagation is difficult and usually does not
 succeed.
 When attempting to train such a network, each node in the output layer
 often just outputs the mean value of the desired output of the training
 cases, independently of the input.
 One problem is that there are many local minima (generated by repeatedly
 adding weighted sigmoid functions) of the implicitly optimized energy function
 during back-propagation.
 Another problem is that in discriminative learning, each training case
 only contributes as many bits to the specification of the parameters of
 the network as needed to specify the label.
 This makes generative models

\begin_layout Subsection
Autoassociator
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:Autoassociator-introduction"

\end_inset

, an autoassociator was described as one of the first networks with a deep
 architecture that could be trained effectively.
 The training is done by iteratively adding layers to the network, and it
 starts with three layers: input layer, where input data is applied, the
 internal hidden layer, which usually has a smaller size than the input
 and output layers, and the output layer, which has the same size as the
 input layer and where the original input should be reconstructed as closely
 as possible.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When training this first iteration of the network, the input patterns are
 taken from the training data set.
 Standard back-propagation is used to adapt the weights between input layer
 and hidden layer and between hidden layer and output layer.
 The goal of training is that the network reconstructs as output patterns
 the input patterns.
 One might think that that is too easy, but usually the number of nodes
 in the hidden layer is chosen to be smaller than the number of nodes in
 the input (and output) layer.
 In this way the autoassociator is forced to reconstruct its input from
 a compressed representation.
 
\begin_inset Note Note
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
(TODO: hier ein Bild eines autoassociator networks.)
\end_layout

\end_inset

 Once back-propagation does not improve the reconstruction error on the
 test set anymore, the second step starts.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the second step, both encoder and decoder are extended by one layer.
 The encoder network is enlarged by an additional hidden layer put on top
 of its existing 1st hidden layer.
 The weights between the 1st and 2nd (new) hidden layer are initialized
 randomly.
 The biases of the nodes in the 2nd (new) hidden layer are also initialized
 (randomly or constantly zero).
 The decoder network is constructed on top of the new hidden 2nd layer by
 inserting weights initialized randomly, copying the 1st hidden layer to
 form the 3rd hidden layer, copying the weights between hidden layer 1 (from
 the first iteration) to the output layer, and copying the output layer
 (from the first iteration).
 Then back-propagation is used to train the autoassociator consisting of
 the new encoder network with the new decoder network on top.
 This establishes values for the values of the initialized weights and biases.
 This process can be repeated until a sufficient number of hidden layers
 has been trained.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Autoassociator with a classifier on top
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The autoassociator as described is an unsupervised algorithm, because it
 only reconstructs its input.
 The autoassociator can however be used in a supervised fashion by first
 training its encoder and decoder networks up to sufficient depth, and then
 removing the decoder network and replacing it by a single output layer
 that has the dimension of the training label.
 The weights between the last hidden layer of the encoder and the new output
 layer as well as the biases of the new output layer are initialized randomly
 (or to constantly zero), and trained using back-propagation.

 Sparse activity constrains the space of possible parameters of the model.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Setting a sparsity target works by scaling the total input to a node by
 a value controlled by three meta-parameters: the sparsity target, the decay
 rate, and the sparsity cost.
 The idea is to scale the total input to a node so that its probability
 of being active 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

 approaches that of a choosable target probability 
\begin_inset Formula $p\ll1$
\end_inset

 (the sparsity target).
 The actual probability of being active 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

 is registered by using an exponentially decaying average of the mean probabilit
y
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
q_{new}=\lambda q_{old}+(1-\lambda)q_{current},
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

 is the decay rate.
 The penalty to the input is measured using the cross entropy between the
 desired distribution and actual activity distribution 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mbox{sparsity penalty}\propto-p\log q-(1-p)\log(1-q).
\]

\end_inset

The derivative of the cross entropy with respect to the total input to a
 node is 
\begin_inset Formula $q-p$
\end_inset

, for nodes with sigmoid activation function.
 (The derivative of the penalty is 0 when the desired is equal to the actual
 activity distribution.) Both the bias and the incoming weights must then
 be adjusted by this derivative, scaled by the sparsity cost.

 This is enforced by 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

dropping
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 each training iteration a random subset of nodes in a layer.
 This prevents subsequent layers from adapting to specific combinations
 of node activations in the previous layer.
 Dropout can be used in any neural network whose input to a node is computed
 from several input nodes.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Dropout specifies a probability 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

 for nodes in a layer to be active during a training iteration.
 In each iteration, on average only 
\begin_inset Formula $d*n$
\end_inset

 nodes' output values are computed and the other nodes are set to contribute
 nothing (zero) to the input to the next layer.
 This greatly constrains complex co-adaptations between nodes, in which
 nodes are only useful in the context of a large number of other nodes.
 It thereby reduces overfitting.
 To utilize all trained nodes during testing, all nodes contribute to the
 computation of input to a layer, but their total input must then be multiplied
 by 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

, to simulate that only a fraction of 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

 nodes are active.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The theory behind dropout is that for a network with 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 nodes, there are

 possible ways to drop out those nodes.
 During testing, a network trained with dropout implicitly averages its
 output over all these 
\begin_inset Formula $2^{n}$

 networks with shared weights.
 Dropping out a random fraction of nodes prevents single nodes from co-adapting
 to the specific working of a large number of other nodes.

 is not really a regularization method, but nevertheless a method to prevent
 overfitting in supervised training of an artificial neural network.
 It is used by splitting the training data set into a real training data
 set and a validation data set, and using only the real training data set
 for adapting the weights and biases during learning.
 After each learning iteration, the validation data set is used to compute
 the output error of the current network.
 After a defined number of training iterations, the neural network that
 had the lowest output error on the validation data set is used as the final
 network to be used in making predictions.

Training a Sigmoid Belief Network is the process of finding weights between

in equation 27

\begin_inset Formula

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{S}$

 are the nodes, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{V}\subset\mathbf{S}$

 are the arbitrarily chosen visible nodes.
 However, in the Deep Belief Network below, the visible nodes are always
 in the last (bottom) layer.
 In the likelihood we have to evaluate the conditional probability 
\begin_inset Formula $P(\mathbf{S}=\mathbf{s}\mid\mathbf{V}=\mathbf{v})$

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since exact inference of the hidden nodes given the visible nodes is intractable
, we must resort to the approximate Gibbs Sampling.
 This works as shown in section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand vref
reference "par:Gibbs-Sampling-in-Markov-Random-Fields"

 However, in Gibbs Sampling, all hidden variables (of all layers simultaneously)

 Therefore another learning algorithm is needed.

As mentioned in section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand vref
reference "par:Exact-Inference-in-Deep-Belief-Networks-is-Complicated"

\end_inset

, there are computational problems with inferring the hidden variables from
 visible ones.
 The problems would go away if the posterior of the hidden given the visible
 nodes were independent between individual hidden nodes, but this is not
 the case due to explaining away.
 However, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "HintonTeh2006"

\end_inset

 came up with a trick: The posterior is equal to the product of prior times
 likelihood.
 If the prior were so that it would cancel the correlations of the likelihood,
 then the product would factor according to the hidden nodes 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{y}$
\end_inset

: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
P(\mathbf{y}\mid\mathbf{x})=\prod_{j}P(y_{j}\mid\mathbf{x}),
\]

\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{\mathbf{x}}$
\end_inset

 are the visible nodes.
 They showed that such priors exist and have the form
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
P(\mathbf{y})=\frac{1}{C}\exp\left(\log\Omega(\mathbf{y})+\sum\alpha_{j}(y_{j})\right),
\]

\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset

 is a normalization constant, 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega$
\end_inset

 is a function of the visible states and the 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{j}$
\end_inset

 are functions depending on the visible nodes individually.
 The desired factorial form of the posterior means that all 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{j}$
\end_inset

 must be conditionally independent (given 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}$
\end_inset

).
 By the Hammersley-Clifford theorem (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "par:The-Hammersley-Clifford-theorem-of-Undirected-Graphical-Model"

\end_inset

) these conditions are fulfilled in an undirected graphical model that has
 edges between every hidden and visible variables and edges between all
 visible nodes with a joint probability of the form
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
P(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})=\frac{1}{C}\exp\left(\sum_{j}\Phi_{j}(\mathbf{x},y_{j})+\beta(\mathbf{x})+\sum_{j}\alpha_{j}(y_{j})\right).\label{eq:DBN-joint-probability-with-dependencies-between-visible}

\end_inset

For reasons that will become clear later, we also want to get rid of the
 dependencies between the visible nodes.
 The conditional probabilities are then of the form
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
P(\mathbf{x}\mid\mathbf{y})=\prod_{i}P(x_{i}\mid\mathbf{y})\label{eq:DBN-x-given-y}

\begin{equation}
P(\mathbf{y}\mid\mathbf{x})=\prod_{j}P(y_{j}\mid\mathbf{x}).\label{eq:DBN-y-given-x}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Also by the Hammersley-Clifford theorem, the joint probability then specializes
 from equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:DBN-joint-probability-with-dependencies-between-visible"

\end_inset

 to
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
P(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})=\frac{1}{C}\exp\left(\sum_{j}\Phi_{j}(\mathbf{x},y_{j})+\sum_{i}\gamma_{i}(x_{i})+\sum_{j}\alpha_{j}(y_{j})\right).
\]

\end_inset

The reason we wanted to have both independencies as encoded by equations
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:DBN-x-given-y"

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:DBN-y-given-x"

\end_inset

 is that these are the (in)dependecies described by a Restricted Boltzmann
 Machine.
 Inference in an RBM works by repeatedly and alternatingly evaluating these
 two conditional probabilities.
 The correctly inferred distribution is obtained once the Markov chain reaches
 equilibrium in iterating.
 However, we can also view this iterative induction as taking place in a
 Deep Belief Network that is infinitely deep, has alternating visible and
 hidden layers and has shared (

\begin_layout Paragraph
The Greedy Training Procedure
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This equivalence makes the following greedy training procedure for a Deep
 Belief Network possible.
 Start with a single RBM containing visible nodes 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{V_{0}}$
\end_inset

 and hidden nodes 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{H_{0}}$
\end_inset

 and train it using contrastive divergence to learn the weights 
\begin_inset Formula $W$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then copy the visible layer together with the weights, turn the copy upside-down
 (i.e.
 transpose the weights), and connect this new layer called 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{V_{1}}$
\end_inset

 to the top of the hidden layer.
 This new 3-layer network is then further modified: The undirected weights
 between 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{V_{0}}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{H_{0}}$
\end_inset

 are 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

untied
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and replaced by directed weights 
\begin_inset Formula $W$
\end_inset

 going from 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{H_{0}}$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{V_{0}}$
\end_inset

, and directed weights 
\begin_inset Formula $W^{T}$
\end_inset

 going from 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{V_{0}}$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{H_{0}}$
\end_inset

.
 The upward weights serve the purpose of inferring the 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{H_{0}}$
\end_inset

 representation of the data, and the downward weights are generative and
 part of the model.
 Place the original RBM (that had been between 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{V_{0}}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{H_{0}}$
\end_inset

) on top of the new layer 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{V_{1}}$
\end_inset

, so that it is now between 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{V_{1}}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{H_{1}}$
\end_inset

.
 Up to now this model is equivalent to running an RBM for one more iteration,
 which is implemented by the extra directed layer with shared weights below
 the RBM.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Infer the hidden layer representation at 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{H_{0}}$
\end_inset

 (i.e.
 feed the activations of the visible layer 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{V_{0}}$
\end_inset

 through the activation function of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{H_{0}}$
\end_inset

).
 Now train the copied RBM between layers 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{V_{1}}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{H_{1}}$
\end_inset

 and adapt its weights.
 This greedy step makes the weights different from those between 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{V_{0}}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{H_{0}}$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{V_{1}}$
\end_inset

, and thus the upward (inferring) weights between 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{V_{0}}\leftarrow\mathbf{H_{0}}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{H_{0}}\leftarrow\mathbf{V_{1}}$
\end_inset

 become incorrect in theory.
 In practice, however, this does not matter that much.
 The gain by training the RBM on top on re-represented data outweighs the
 incorrectness of inference.
 Because the weights of the new RBM before training are initialized to be
 the same as that of the old RBM, additional constrastive divergence steps
 can only improve the model.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Iteratively adding two new layers between the directed layers of the Deep
 Belief Network and the RBM on top can now continue until the model is sufficien
tly deep.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
The RBM Seen as the DBN's Markov Chain in Reverse
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another way to view the unrolling is to regard the infinitely Deep Belief
 Network as the process implementing the original Markov Chain.
 The Markov Chain implemented by the RBM in the unrolling of the DBN can
 then be regarded as simulating the same Markov Chain run in reverse, and
 the more layers we add to the DBN, the farther back we go in time.

A trained DBN can be reinterpreted as a feed-forward neural network.
 In particular, the weights and biases of a trained DBN can be transferred
 to a multi-layer feed-forward neural network with the same architecture
 as the DBN, thereby making the stochastic DBN a deterministic neural network.

 Furthermore, another neural network can be put on top of the pre-trained

 to variables to be predicted.
 Usually the network consists of only one layer, due to difficulties in
 training freshly initialized multi-layer neural networks.

\begin_layout Standard
In such a composite structure, the (unsupervisedly trained) DBN weights
 take on the responsibility of re-representing the data so that it is in
 an abstracted form that has for example correlating variables replaced
 by a single variable indicating whether a feature is present in the sample
 or not.
 The (supervisedly trained) weights on top of the network have the responsibilit
y to label the sample, i.e.
 indicate whether the abstracted representation of the sample is of a certain
 form or not.

\begin_layout Standard
Because autoencoders

 are composed of an encoder
\begin_inset Index idx

\end_layout

\end_inset

 and a decoder

\begin_layout Plain Layout

 and the encoder tries to compress the input data and the decoder tries
 to reconstruct the input from its compressed form, training them is unsupervise

 As a general rule only the samples designated as

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The decoder network of the trained autoencoder was then thrown away, so
 that only the encoder remained.
 Classification was done on the compressed representation of the input.
 The classifier network was built on top of the encoder (see figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

reference "fig:supervised-network-on-top-of-unsupervised"

\end_inset

), and the compressed output layer of the encoder was used as the input
 layer of the classifier.

Example scheme showing how the supervised network is trained on top of a
 pre-trained unsupervised network.
 The network receives input from the bottom, and the resulting label is
 read off at the top.
 The unsupervised network can be more than 2 layers deep.
 It is trained first during pre-training.
 Then the supervised network is appended onto the top and trained together
 with the unsupervised network.

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The weights of the classifier were initialized randomly, and standard back-propa
gation was used to train the whole network to classify samples.
 This means that the encoder can be modified by back-propagation training,
 but pre-training with the autoencoder initializes it to a configuration
 that 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

knows
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 about the unlabeled samples.
 The learning rate of the second training run (

How Unlabeled Data was Used When Pre-training a Restricted Boltzmann Machine
 and Fine-tuning Using Back-propagation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When using the unsupervised Restricted Boltzmann Machine to find the approximate
 weights of a neural network, the unlabeled data were used to train the
 Restricted Boltzmann Machine.
 The resulting neural network was then extended with the network layer for
 supervised classification, and the complete network was trained using (supervis
ed) back-propagation on the labeled data.

\begin_layout Subsubsection
How Unlabeled Data was Used in Training Deep Belief Networks
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As was said in section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand vref
reference "sub:Deep-Belief-Network"

\end_inset

, Deep Belief Networks are an unsupervised algorithm and thus were trained
 using unlabeled data.
 As with Restricted Boltzmann Machines, the resulting network was then extended
 with the classifier layer, and the complete network was fine-tuned using
 back-propagation on the labeled data.
